org.kuali.rice.krad.datadictionary.validation.constraint.BaseConstraint=A class that implements the required accessor for label keys. This provides a convenient base class\n from which other constraints can be derived.\n\n Only BaseConstraints can have state validation.\n\n This class is a direct copy of one that was in Kuali Student.
org.kuali.rice.krad.datadictionary.validation.constraint.BaseConstraint|applyClientSide|Boolean=If this is true, the constraint should be applied on the client side when the user interacts with\n a field - if this constraint can be interpreted for client side use. Default is true.
org.kuali.rice.krad.datadictionary.validation.constraint.BaseConstraint|constraintStateOverrides|List=Get the list of constraintStateOverrides which represent constraints that will replace THIS constraint\n when their state is matched during validation.\n Because of this, constraints added to this list MUST have their states defined.\n\n <p>ConstraintStateOverrides always take precedence over this\n constraint if they apply to the state being evaluated during validation.  These settings have no effect if\n there is no stateMapping represented on the entry/view being evaluated.\n </p>
org.kuali.rice.krad.datadictionary.validation.constraint.BaseConstraint|messageComponentCode|String=A code within the namespace that identifies a component or group the constraint message is associated with\n\n <p>\n Used with the namespace and error key for retrieving the constraint text. If null,\n the default component code will be used\n </p>
org.kuali.rice.krad.datadictionary.validation.constraint.BaseConstraint|messageKey|String=A key that is used to retrieve the constraint message text (used with the namespace and component\n code if specified)
org.kuali.rice.krad.datadictionary.validation.constraint.BaseConstraint|messageNamespaceCode|String=Namespace code (often an application or module code) the constraint failure message is associated with\n\n <p>\n Used with the component code and error key for retrieving the constraint. If null,\n the default namespace code will be used\n </p>
org.kuali.rice.krad.datadictionary.validation.constraint.BaseConstraint|states|List=A list of states to apply this constraint for, this will effect when a constraint\n is applied.\n\n <p>Each state this constraint is applied for needs to be declared with few additional options\:\n <ul>\n <li>if NO states are defined for this constraint, this constraint is applied for ALL states</li>\n <li>if a state is defined with a + symbol, example "state+", then this constraint will be applied for that state\n and ALL following states</li>\n <li>if a state is defined as a range with ">", example "state1>state6", then this constraint will be applied for\n all\n states from state1 to state6 </li>\n </ul>\n These can be mixed and matched, as appropriate, though states using a + symbol should always be the last\n item of a list (as they imply this state and everything else after).</p>\n\n <p>Example state list may be\: ["state1", "state3>state5", "state6+"].  In this example, note that this\n constraint\n is never applied to "state2" (assuming these example states represent a state order by number)</p>
org.kuali.rice.krad.datadictionary.validation.constraint.BaseConstraint|validationMessageParams|List=Parameters to be used in the string retrieved by this constraint's messageKey, ordered by number of\n the param
org.kuali.rice.krad.datadictionary.validation.constraint.CaseConstraint=CaseConstraint is imposed only when a certain condition is met\n\n <p>For example, if the country attribute value is "USA",\n then a prerequisite constraint may be imposed that the 'State' attribute is non-null.</p>\n\n <p>\n This class is a direct copy of one that was in Kuali Student.</p>
org.kuali.rice.krad.datadictionary.validation.constraint.CaseConstraint|caseSensitive|boolean=checks whether string comparison will be carried out in a case sensitive fashion
org.kuali.rice.krad.datadictionary.validation.constraint.CaseConstraint|operator|String=specifies the kind of relationship to be checked between the actual value and the ones defined in the {@link\n \#getWhenConstraint()}

org.kuali.rice.krad.datadictionary.validation.constraint.ConfigurationBasedRegexPatternConstraint|patternTypeKey|String=Message key used to identify the validation pattern
org.kuali.rice.krad.datadictionary.validation.constraint.DatePatternConstraint=DatePatternConstraint constrains a field to only allow dates which are part of the formats\n defined in the system. Constraining a field all these formats is often not appropriate for\n fields, and you may want to constrain the input to a subset of the allowed formats in the system.\n This can be done by setting the allowed formats to this subset (see BasicDatePatternConstraint\n bean for example)
org.kuali.rice.krad.datadictionary.validation.constraint.DatePatternConstraint|allowedFormats|List=

org.kuali.rice.krad.datadictionary.validation.constraint.MustOccurConstraint=Must occur constraints are constraints that indicate some range of acceptable valid results. So a must occur\n constraint\n might indicate that between 1 and 3 prequisite constraints must be valid. For example, on a person object, it might\n be\n that one of three fields must be filled in\:\n\n 1. username\n 2. email\n 3. phone number\n\n By imposing a must occur constraint on the person object iself, and setting three prequisite constraints below it,\n with a min of 1\n and a max of 3, this requirement can be enforced.\n\n A more complicated example might be that a US address is only valid if it provides either\:\n (a) a city and state, or\n (b) a postal code\n\n To enforce this, a single must occur constraint would have two children\: (1) a prequisite constraint on postal code,\n and (2) a must occur constraint\n with two child prequisite constraints, on city and state, respectively. By setting min\=1/max\=2 at the top must occur\n constraint,\n and min\=2/max\=2 at the leaf constraint, this requirement can be enforced.

org.kuali.rice.krad.datadictionary.validation.constraint.NumericPatternConstraint=Pattern for matching numeric characters, difference between NumericPatternConstraint and IntegerPatternConstraint\n is that a numeric pattern constraint is for matching numeric characters and can be mixed with other characters\n by setting allow flags on, while integer is for only positive/negative numbers
org.kuali.rice.krad.datadictionary.validation.constraint.PrerequisiteConstraint=Prerequisite constraints require that some other attribute be non-empty in order for the constraint to be valid.\n So, a 7-digit US phone number might have a prerequisite of an area code, or an address street2 might have a\n prerequisite\n that street1 is non-empty.
org.kuali.rice.krad.datadictionary.validation.constraint.PrerequisiteConstraint|propertyName|String=
org.kuali.rice.krad.datadictionary.validation.constraint.SimpleConstraint=A simple constraint stores 'basic' constraints for a field.  This constraint is meant to be used as a\n constraint for WhenConstraints in CaseConstraint, and is also used internally in InputField.

org.kuali.rice.krad.datadictionary.validation.constraint.SimpleConstraint|minLength|Integer=The minimum amount of characters this field's value has to be
org.kuali.rice.krad.datadictionary.validation.constraint.SimpleConstraint|minOccurs|Integer=The minimum amount of items in this fields list of values - not yet used/do not use
org.kuali.rice.krad.datadictionary.validation.constraint.SimpleConstraint|required|Boolean=If true the field is required
org.kuali.rice.krad.datadictionary.validation.constraint.UTF8AnyCharacterPatternConstraint=Pattern for matching any printable character
org.kuali.rice.krad.datadictionary.validation.constraint.UTF8AnyCharacterPatternConstraint|allowWhitespace|boolean=
org.kuali.rice.krad.datadictionary.validation.constraint.UTF8AnyCharacterPatternConstraint|omitNewline|boolean=
org.kuali.rice.krad.datadictionary.validation.constraint.ValidCharactersConstraint=This is a constraint that limits attribute values to some subset of valid characters or to match a particular\n regular\n expression.\n\n For example\:\n - To limit to both upper and lower-case letters, value can be set to "[A-Za-z]*"\n - To limit to any character except carriage returns and line feeds, value can be set to "[^\\n\\r]*"
org.kuali.rice.krad.datadictionary.validation.constraint.ValidCharactersConstraint|value|String=The Java based regex for valid characters\n This value should include the ^ and $ symbols if needed
org.kuali.rice.krad.datadictionary.validation.constraint.ValidCharactersPatternConstraint=This abstract class extends from ValidCharactersConstraint. Its subclasses contain a regex that\n is built out with flags that can be turned off and on. All ValidCharactersPatternConstraints\n allow a certain set of characters to be repeated multiple times
org.kuali.rice.krad.datadictionary.validation.constraint.ValidCharactersPatternConstraint|value|String=The Java based regex for valid characters\n This value should include the ^ and $ symbols if needed
org.kuali.rice.krad.datadictionary.validation.constraint.ValidDataPatternConstraint=
org.kuali.rice.krad.datadictionary.validation.constraint.ValidDataPatternConstraint|value|String=The Java based regex for valid characters\n This value should include the ^ and $ symbols if needed
org.kuali.rice.krad.datadictionary.validation.constraint.WhenConstraint={@code WhenConstraint} is a child of a {@link CaseConstraint}\n\n <p>It provides a specific additional constraint that should be processed when\n the condition itself is true.</p>\n\n <p>So a case constraint on country, might have a when constraint with value\='USA', and another with value\='Canada'.\n Each of these\n {@code WhenConstraint}'s would define a constraint of their own that would only be processed when the country was\n USA, or when the country\n was Canada.</p>\n\n <p>A {@code WhenConstraint} either specifies an attribute path whose value it then provides or a constraint.\n The parent @{CaseConstraint} is defined on the field on which the constraints are desired to take effect.</p>
org.kuali.rice.krad.datadictionary.validation.constraint.WhenConstraint|constraint|Constraint=gets the constraint to apply to the field when the {@code WhenConstraint} value/values match
org.kuali.rice.krad.datadictionary.validation.constraint.WhenConstraint|valuePath|String=gets a path that can retrieve an attributes value
org.kuali.rice.krad.datadictionary.validation.constraint.WhenConstraint|values|List=gets the list of values defined for this constraint
org.kuali.rice.krad.uif.component.BindingInfo=Provides binding configuration for an DataBinding component (attribute or\n collection)\n\n <p>\n From the binding configuration the binding path is determined (if not\n manually set) and used to set the path in the UI or to get the value from the\n model\n </p>
org.kuali.rice.krad.uif.component.BindingInfo|bindByNamePrefix|String=Prefix that will be used to form the binding path from the component\n name. Typically used for nested collection properties
org.kuali.rice.krad.uif.component.BindingInfo|bindToForm|boolean=Indicates whether the component binds directly to the form (that is its\n bindingName gives a property available through the form), or whether is\n binds through a nested form object. If bindToForm is false, it is assumed\n the component binds to the object given by the form property whose path\n is configured by bindingObjectPath.
org.kuali.rice.krad.uif.component.BindingInfo|bindToMap|boolean=Indicates whether the parent object for the property that we are binding\n to is a Map. If true the binding path will be adjusted to use the map key\n syntax
org.kuali.rice.krad.uif.component.BindingInfo|bindingName|String=Gives the name of the property that the component binds to. The name can\n be nested but not the full path, just from the parent object or in the\n case of binding directly to the form from the form object\n\n <p>\n If blank this will be set from the name field of the component\n </p>
org.kuali.rice.krad.uif.component.BindingInfo|bindingObjectPath|String=For attribute fields that do not belong to the default form object (given\n by the view), this field specifies the path to the object (on the form)\n the attribute does belong to.\n\n <p>\n e.g. Say we have an attribute field with property name 'number', that\n belongs to the object given by the 'account' property on the form. The\n form object path would therefore be set to 'account'. If the property\n belonged to the object given by the 'document.header' property of the\n form, the binding object path would be set to 'document.header'. Note if\n the binding object path is not set for an attribute field (or any\n <code>DataBinding</code> component), the binding object path configured\n on the <code>View</code> will be used (unless bindToForm is set to true,\n where is assumed the property is directly available from the form).\n </p>
org.kuali.rice.krad.uif.component.BindingInfo|bindingPath|String=Path to the property on the model the component binds to. Uses standard\n dot notation for nested properties. If the binding path was manually set\n it will be returned as it is, otherwise the path will be formed by using\n the binding object path and the bind prefix\n\n <p>\n e.g. Property name 'foo' on a model would have binding path "foo", while\n property name 'name' of the nested model property 'account' would have\n binding path "account.name"\n </p>
org.kuali.rice.krad.uif.component.ComponentBase=Base implementation of <code>Component</code> which other component\n implementations should extend\n\n <p>\n Provides base component properties such as id and template. Also provides\n default implementation for the <code>ScriptEventSupport</code> and\n <code>Ordered</code> interfaces. By default no script events except the\n onDocumentReady are supported.\n </p>
org.kuali.rice.krad.uif.component.ComponentBase|additionalComponentsToRefresh|List=Returns a list of componentIds which will be also be refreshed when this component is refreshed\n\n <p>\n This will be a comma separated list of componentIds that need to be refreshed when a refresh\n condition has been set on this component.\n </p>
org.kuali.rice.krad.uif.component.ComponentBase|align|String=Horizontal alignment of the component within its container\n\n <p>\n All components belong to a <code>Container</code> and are placed using a\n <code>LayoutManager</code>. This property specifies how the component\n should be aligned horizontally within the container. During the finalize\n phase the CSS text-align style will be created for the align setting.\n </p>
org.kuali.rice.krad.uif.component.ComponentBase|colSpan|int=Number of places the component should take up horizontally in the\n container\n\n <p>\n All components belong to a {@code Container} and are placed using a\n {@code LayoutManager}. This property specifies how many places\n horizontally the component should take up within the container. This is\n only applicable for table based layout managers. Default is 1\n </p>\n\n TODO\: this should not be on component interface since it only applies if\n the layout manager supports it, need some sort of layoutOptions map for\n field level options that depend on the manager
org.kuali.rice.krad.uif.component.ComponentBase|componentModifiers|List={@code ComponentModifier} instances that should be invoked to\n initialize the component\n\n <p>\n These provide dynamic initialization behavior for the component and are\n configured through the components definition. Each initializer will get\n invoked by the initialize method.\n </p>
org.kuali.rice.krad.uif.component.ComponentBase|componentSecurity|ComponentSecurity=Security object that indicates what authorization (permissions) exist for the component
org.kuali.rice.krad.uif.component.ComponentBase|conditionalRefresh|String=When set if the condition is satisfied, the component will be refreshed.\n\n <p>The component MUST BE a container or field type. conditionalRefresh is\n defined in a limited Spring EL syntax. Only valid form property names,\n and, or, logical comparison operators (non-arithmetic), and the matches\n clause are allowed. String and regex values must use single quotes ('),\n booleans must be either true or false, numbers must be a valid double\n either negative or positive.\n\n <p>DO NOT use progressiveRender and conditionalRefresh on the same component\n unless it is known that the component will always be visible in all cases\n when a conditionalRefresh happens (ie conditionalRefresh has\n progressiveRender's condition anded with its own condition). <b>If a\n component should be refreshed every time it is shown, use the\n progressiveRenderAndRefresh option with this property instead.</b></p>
org.kuali.rice.krad.uif.component.ComponentBase|context|Map=Context map for the component\n\n <p>\n Any el statements configured for the components properties (e.g.\n title\="@{foo.property}") are evaluated using the el context map. This map\n will get populated with default objects like the model, view, and request\n from the {@code ViewHelperService}. Other components can push\n further objects into the context so that they are available for use with\n that component. For example, {@code Field} instances that are part\n of a collection line as receive the current line instance\n </p>\n\n <p>\n Context map also provides objects to methods that are invoked for\n {@code GeneratedField} instances\n </p>\n\n <p>\n The Map key gives the name of the variable that can be used within\n expressions, and the Map value gives the object instance for which\n expressions containing the variable should evaluate against\n </p>\n\n <p>\n NOTE\: Calling getContext().putAll() will skip updating any configured property replacers for the\n component. Instead you should call \#pushAllToContext\n </p>
org.kuali.rice.krad.uif.component.ComponentBase|cssClasses|List=CSS style class(s) to be applied to the component\n\n <p>\n Declares style classes for the component. Multiple classes are specified\n with a space delimiter. This is used by the renderer to set the class\n attribute on the corresponding element. The class(s) declared must be\n available in the common style sheets or the style sheets specified for\n the view\n </p>
org.kuali.rice.krad.uif.component.ComponentBase|dataAttributes|Map=Get the dataAttributes setup for this component - to be written to the html/jQuery data\n\n <p>The attributes that are complex objects (contain {}) they will be written through script.\n The attritubes that are simple (contain no objects) will be written directly to the html of the\n component using standard data-.\n Either way they can be access through .data() call in jQuery</p>
org.kuali.rice.krad.uif.component.ComponentBase|disableSessionPersistence|boolean=Disables the storage of the component in session (when the framework determines it needs to be due to a\n refresh condition)\n\n <p>\n When the framework determines there is a condition on the component that requires it to keep around between\n posts, it will store the component instance in session. This flag can be set to disable this behavior (which\n would require custom application logic to support behavior such as refresh)\n </p>
org.kuali.rice.krad.uif.component.ComponentBase|finalizeMethodAdditionalArguments|List=The List of Object instances that should be passed as arguments to the finalize method\n\n <p>\n These arguments are passed to the finalize method after the standard model and component\n arguments. They are passed in the order declared in the list\n </p>
org.kuali.rice.krad.uif.component.ComponentBase|finalizeMethodInvoker|MethodInvokerConfig={@code MethodInvokerConfig} instance for the method that should be invoked\n for finalizing the component configuration\n\n <p>\n MethodInvoker can be configured to specify the class or object the method\n should be called on. For static method invocations, the targetClass\n property can be configured. For object invocations, that targetObject\n property can be configured\n </p>\n\n <p>\n If the component is selfRendered, the finalize method can return a string which\n will be set as the component's renderOutput. The selfRendered indicator will also\n be set to true on the component.\n </p>
org.kuali.rice.krad.uif.component.ComponentBase|finalizeMethodToCall|String=The name of the method that should be invoked for finalizing the component\n configuration (full method name, without parameters or return type)\n\n <p>\n Note the method can also be set with the finalizeMethodInvoker\n targetMethod property. If the method is on the configured\n {@code ViewHelperService}, only this property needs to be configured\n </p>\n\n <p>\n The model backing the view will be passed as the first argument method and then\n the {@code Component} instance as the second argument. If any additional method\n arguments are declared with the finalizeMethodAdditionalArguments, they will then\n be passed in the order declared in the list\n </p>\n\n <p>\n If the component is selfRendered, the finalize method can return a string which\n will be set as the component's renderOutput. The selfRendered indicator will also\n be set to true on the component.\n </p>
org.kuali.rice.krad.uif.component.ComponentBase|forceSessionPersistence|boolean=Indicates whether the component should be stored with the session view regardless of configuration\n\n <p>\n By default the framework nulls out any components that do not have a refresh condition or are needed for\n collection processing. This can be a problem if custom application code is written to refresh a component\n without setting the corresponding component flag. In this case this property can be set to true to force the\n framework to keep the component in session. Defaults to false\n </p>
org.kuali.rice.krad.uif.component.ComponentBase|hidden|boolean=Indicates whether the component should be hidden in the UI\n\n <p>\n How the hidden data is maintained depends on the views persistence mode.\n If the mode is request, the corresponding data will be rendered to the UI\n but not visible. If the mode is session, the data will not be rendered to\n the UI but maintained server side.\n </p>\n\n <p>\n For a {@code Container} component, the hidden setting will apply to\n all contained components (making a section hidden makes all fields within\n the section hidden)\n </p>
org.kuali.rice.krad.uif.component.ComponentBase|id|String=The unique id (within a given tree) for the component\n\n <p>\n The id will be used by renderers to set the HTML element id. This gives a way to find various elements\n for scripting. If the id is not given, a default will be generated by the framework\n </p>
org.kuali.rice.krad.uif.component.ComponentBase|methodToCallOnRefresh|String=Name of a method on the controller that should be invoked as part of the component refresh and disclosure\n process\n\n <p>\n During the component refresh or disclosure process it might be necessary to perform other operations, such as\n preparing data or executing a business process. This allows the configuration of a method on the underlying\n controller that should be called for the component refresh action. In this method, the necessary logic can be\n performed and then the base component update method invoked to carry out the component refresh.\n </p>\n\n <p>\n Controller method to invoke must accept the form, binding result, request, and response arguments\n </p>
org.kuali.rice.krad.uif.component.ComponentBase|onBlurScript|String=Script that should be executed when the component's onBlur event is fired
org.kuali.rice.krad.uif.component.ComponentBase|onChangeScript|String=Script that should be executed when the component's onChange event is\n fired

org.kuali.rice.krad.uif.component.ComponentBase|progressiveRenderAndRefresh|boolean=If true, when the progressiveRender condition is satisfied, the component\n will always be retrieved from the server and shown(as opposed to being\n stored on the client, but hidden, after the first retrieval as is the\n case with the progressiveRenderViaAJAX option).\n\n <p><b>By default, this is\n false, so components with progressive render capabilities will always be\n already within the client html and toggled to be hidden or visible.</b></p>
org.kuali.rice.krad.uif.component.ComponentBase|progressiveRenderViaAJAX|boolean=When progressiveRenderViaAJAX is true, this component will be retrieved\n from the server when it first satisfies its progressive render condition.\n\n <p>After the first retrieval, it is hidden/shown in the html by the js when\n its progressive condition result changes. <b>By default, this is false,\n so components with progressive render capabilities will always be already\n within the client html and toggled to be hidden or visible.</b></p>
org.kuali.rice.krad.uif.component.ComponentBase|progressiveRender|String=When set if the condition is satisfied, the component will be displayed.

org.kuali.rice.krad.uif.component.PropertyReplacer=Configuration for replacing a property value based on a condition\n\n <p>\n A <code>Component</code> may be configured with one or more <code>PropertyReplacer</code> instances. Each defines\n a condition to evaluate during the apply model phase, and if that condition succeeds the property on the component\n given by {@link \#getPropertyName()}, will be replaced with the value given by {@link \#getReplacement()}. Conditions\n are defined using an expression language and may reference any variables available in the component's context.\n </p>\n\n <p>\n Property replacers can be used to change out an entire Component or List/Map of Components. For example, based on a\n condition you might want to display a <code>TextControl</code> or <code>RadioControl</code> for an\n <code>InputField</code>. You can define the field with a text control, then include a property replacer as\n follows\:\n <pre>\n <bean parent\="PropertyReplacer" p\:propertyName\="control"\n p\:condition\="field1 eq '10985'" p\:replacement-ref\="RadioControl"/>\n\n </pre>\n\n Note <code>Component</code> contains a <code>List</code> or property replacers which will be evaluated in the order\n contained within the list. So in the above example if we wanted to now add a further condition which sets the\n control\n to a checkbox, we would just add another property replacer bean.\n <pre>\n   <property name\="propertyReplacers">\n <list>\n <bean parent\="PropertyReplacer" p\:propertyName\="control"\n p\:condition\="field1 eq '10985'" p\:replacement-ref\="RadioControl"/>\n <bean parent\="PropertyReplacer" p\:propertyName\="control"\n p\:condition\="field1 eq '11456'" p\:replacement-ref\="CheckboxControl"/>\n     </list>\n   </property>\n </pre>\n\n Property replacers may be used to substitute primitive properties as well, such as Strings\n </p>

If the resulting boolean is true, the object given by {@link \#getReplacement()}\n will be set as the value for the associated property on the component. If the resulting\n boolean is false, no action will take place\n </p>\n\n <p>\n Note the value does not need to contain the expression placeholder @{}\n </p>
org.kuali.rice.krad.uif.component.PropertyReplacer|propertyName|String=Name of the property on the Component the property replacer is associated with that\n will be set when the condition for the replacer succeeds\n\n <p>\n Note the property name must be readable/writable on the component.

Further more the properties for the field are constructed with code. This gives the ability to specify\n where that list of fields should be placed, along with configured on how to retrieve the remote fields.\n </p>\n\n <p>\n The fetching properties are used to configure what method to invoke that will return the list of remotable fields.\n Specifying the {@link \#getFetchingMethodToCall()} only assumes the method is on the view helper service for the\n contained view. For invoking other classes, such as services or static classes, use {@link\n \#getFetchingMethodInvoker()}\n </p>\n\n <p>\n The list of remotable fields should bind to a Map property on the model. The {@link \#getPropertyName()} and\n {@link \#getBindingInfo()} properties specify the path to this property. The property names configured on the\n returned fields are assumed to be keys in that above configured map, with the corresponding map value giving the\n actual model value for the remote field.\n </p>\n\n <p>\n e.g. configuration\n {@code\n <property name\="items">\n <list>\n <bean parent\="RemoteFieldsHolder" p\:propertyName\="remoteFieldValuesMap"\n p\:fetchingMethodToCall\="retrieveRemoteFields"/>\n ...\n }\n\n This example will invoke a method named 'retrieveRemoteFields' on the view helper service, which should return\n a list of {@link RemotableAttributeField} instances. The view, model instance, and parent container will be sent\n to the method as arguments.\n\n The returned fields will be translated to {@link InputField} instances that bind to a map property named\n 'remoteFieldValuesMap' on the model.\n </p>
org.kuali.rice.krad.uif.field.RemoteFieldsHolder|bindingInfo|BindingInfo=Can be used to for more complex binding paths\n\n <p>\n Generally not necessary to set on a field level, any default object path or binding prefixes set\n on the view or container will be inherited\n </p>
org.kuali.rice.krad.uif.field.RemoteFieldsHolder|fetchingMethodInvoker|MethodInvokerConfig=Configuration for the method to invoke for retrieving the list of remotable fields\n\n <p>\n Through the method invoker config, a service or static class can be configured along with the\n method name that will be invoked. The method name must accept the view, model object, and parent\n container as arguments, and return a list of {@link RemotableAttributeField} instances.\n </p>\n\n <p>\n Note the {@link org.kuali.rice.krad.uif.component.MethodInvokerConfig\#getTargetMethod()} property can\n be configured, or the {@link \#getFetchingMethodToCall()}. In the case of both configurations, the target\n method on the method invoker config will be used\n </p>
org.kuali.rice.krad.uif.field.RemoteFieldsHolder|fetchingMethodToCall|String=Name of the method to invoke for retrieving the list of remotable fields\n\n <p>\n When only the fetching method to call is configured it is assumed to be a valid method on the view\n helper service for the containing view. The method name must accept the view, model object, and parent\n container as arguments, and return a list of {@link RemotableAttributeField} instances.\n </p>\n\n <p>\n For invoking the method on classes other than the view helper service, see {@link \#getFetchingMethodInvoker()}\n </p>
org.kuali.rice.krad.uif.field.RemoteFieldsHolder|propertyName|String=Path to the Map property that the translated fields bind to\n\n <p>\n It is assumed this property points to a Map where the property names on the returned remotable fields\n are keys in that map, with the corresponding map value giving the model value for the field\n </p>
org.kuali.rice.krad.uif.field.SpaceField=Field that produces only a space\n\n <p>\n Can be used to aid in the layout of other fields, for instance in a grid. For\n example in a totals row generally the rows that are not totaled are blank in\n the total row.\n </p>

org.kuali.rice.krad.uif.layout.GridLayoutManager=Layout manager that organizes its components in a table based grid\n\n <p>\n Items are laid out from left to right (with each item taking up one column)\n until the configured number of columns is reached. If the item count is\n greater than the number of columns, a new row will be created to render the\n remaining items (and so on until all items are placed). Labels for the fields\n can be pulled out (default) and rendered as a separate column. The manager\n also supports the column span and row span options for the field items. If\n not specified the default is 1.\n </p>
org.kuali.rice.krad.uif.layout.GridLayoutManager|applyAlternatingRowStyles|boolean=Indicates whether alternating row styles should be applied\n\n <p>\n Indicator to layout manager templates to apply alternating row styles.\n See the configured template for the actual style classes used\n </p>

org.kuali.rice.krad.uif.layout.GridLayoutManager|renderAlternatingHeaderColumns|boolean=Indicates whether header columns (th for tables) should be rendered for\n every other item (alternating)\n\n <p>\n If true the first cell of each row will be rendered as an header, with\n every other cell in the row as a header\n </p>
org.kuali.rice.krad.uif.layout.GridLayoutManager|renderFirstRowHeader|boolean=Indicates whether the first row of items rendered should all be rendered as table header (th) cells\n\n <p>\n Generally when using a grid layout all the cells will be tds or alternating th/td (with the label in the\n th cell). However in some cases it might be desired to display the labels in one row as table header cells (th)\n followed by a row with the corresponding fields in td cells. When this is enabled this type of layout is\n possible\n </p>
org.kuali.rice.krad.uif.layout.GridLayoutManager|renderRowFirstCellHeader|boolean=Indicates whether the first cell of each row should be rendered as a header cell (th)\n\n <p>\n When this flag is turned on, the first cell for each row will be rendered as a header cell. If\n {@link \#isRenderAlternatingHeaderColumns()} is false, the remaining cells for the row will be rendered\n as data cells, else they will alternate between cell headers\n </p>
org.kuali.rice.krad.uif.layout.GridLayoutManager|rowCssClasses|List=The list of styles for each row\n\n <p>\n Each entry in the list gives the style for the row with the same index. This style will be added the the <tr>\n tag\n when the table rows are rendered in the grid.tag. This is used to store the styles for newly added lines and\n other special cases like the add item row.\n </p>
org.kuali.rice.krad.uif.layout.GridLayoutManager|suppressLineWrapping|boolean=Indicates whether the number of columns for the table data should match\n the number of fields given in the container's items list (so that each\n field takes up one column without wrapping), this overrides the configured\n numberOfColumns\n\n <p>\n If set to true during the initialize phase the number of columns will be\n set to the size of the container's field list, if false the configured\n number of columns is used\n </p>
org.kuali.rice.krad.uif.layout.StackedLayoutManager=Layout manager that works with {@code CollectionGroup} containers and\n renders the collection lines in a vertical row\n\n <p>\n For each line of the collection, a {@code Group} instance is created.\n The group header contains a label for the line (summary information), the\n group fields are the collection line fields, and the group footer contains\n the line actions. All the groups are rendered using the\n {@code BoxLayoutManager} with vertical orientation.\n </p>\n\n <p>\n Modify the lineGroupPrototype to change header/footer styles or any other\n customization for the line groups\n </p>
org.kuali.rice.krad.uif.layout.StackedLayoutManager|addLineGroup|Group=Group instance that will be used for the add line\n\n <p>\n Add line fields and actions configured on the\n {@code CollectionGroup} will be set onto the add line group (if add\n line is enabled).

org.kuali.rice.krad.uif.layout.StackedLayoutManager|summaryFields|List=List of attribute names from the collection line class that should be\n used to build the line summary. To build the summary the value for each\n attribute is retrieved from the line instance. All the values are then\n placed together with a separator.
org.kuali.rice.krad.uif.layout.StackedLayoutManager|summaryTitle|String=Text to appears in the header for each collection lines Group. Used in\n conjunction with {@link \#getSummaryFields()} to build up the final header\n text
org.kuali.rice.krad.uif.layout.StackedLayoutManager|wrapperGroup|Group=Group that will 'wrap' the generated collection lines so that they have a different layout from the general\n stacked layout\n\n <p>\n By default (when the wrapper group is null), each collection line will become a group and the groups are\n rendered one after another. If the wrapper group is configured, the generated groups will be inserted as the\n items for the wrapper group, and the layout manager configured for the wrapper group will determine how they\n are rendered. For example, the layout manager could be a grid layout configured for three columns, which would\n layout the first three lines horizontally then break to a new row.\n </p>
org.kuali.rice.krad.uif.layout.TableLayoutManager=Layout manager that works with {@code CollectionGroup} components and\n renders the collection as a Table\n\n <p>\n Based on the fields defined, the {@code TableLayoutManager} will\n dynamically create instances of the fields for each collection row. In\n addition, the manager can create standard fields like the action and sequence\n fields for each row. The manager supports options inherited from the\n {@code GridLayoutManager} such as rowSpan, colSpan, and cell width\n settings.\n </p>

org.kuali.rice.krad.uif.layout.TableLayoutManager|groupingTitle|String=Get the groupingTitle.  The groupingTitle MUST contain a SpringEL expression to uniquely identify a\n group's line (ie it cannot be a static string because each group must be identified by some value).\n <b>This overrides groupingPropertyNames(if set) because it provides full control of grouping value used by\n the collection.  SpringEL defined here must use \#lp if referencing values of the line.</b>

Storing\n the form instance in session allows many things\:\n\n <ul>\n <li>Data does not need to be rebuilt for each server request (for example a collection)</li>\n <li>Data that does not need to go to the user can remain on the form, reducing the size of the response and\n improving security</li>\n <li>Data can be keep around in a 'pre-save' state. When requested by the user changes can then be persisted to\n the database</li>\n <li>Certain information about the view that was rendered, such as input fields, collection paths, and refresh\n components can be kept on the form to support UI interaction</li>\n </ul>\n\n Setting this flag to false will prevent the form from being kept in session and as a result will limit what can\n be done by the framework. In almost all cases this is not recommended.\n </p>\n\n <p>\n Note all forms will be cleared when the user session expires (based on the rice configuration). In addition, the\n framework enables clear points on certain actions to remove the form when it is no longer needed\n </p>
org.kuali.rice.krad.uif.view.View|preLoadScript|String=Script that is executed at the beginning of page load (before any other script)\n\n <p>\n Many used to set server variables client side\n </p>
org.kuali.rice.krad.uif.view.View|preloadPoolSize|int=Specifies the size of the pool that will contain pre-loaded views\n\n <p>\n The spring loading of some views can take a few seconds which hurts performance.

org.kuali.rice.krad.uif.widget.Inquiry=Widget for rendering an Inquiry link or DirectInquiry action field\n\n <p>\n The inquiry widget will render a button for the field value when\n that field is editable. When read only the widget will create a link on the display value.\n It points to the associated inquiry view for the field. The inquiry can be configured to point to a certain\n {@code InquiryView}, or the framework will attempt to associate the\n field with a inquiry based on its metadata (in particular its\n relationships in the model).\n </p>
org.kuali.rice.krad.uif.widget.Inquiry|baseInquiryUrl|String=Returns the URL for the inquiry for which parameters will be added\n\n <p>\n The base URL includes the domain, context, and controller mapping for the inquiry invocation.

org.kuali.rice.krad.uif.widget.Inquiry|inquiryParameters|Map=Map that determines what properties from a calling view will be sent to properties on the inquiry data object\n\n <p>\n When invoking an inquiry view, a query is done against the inquiries configured data object and the resulting\n record is display. The values for the properties configured within the inquiry parameters Map will be\n pulled and passed along as values for the inquiry data object properties (thus they form the criteria for\n the inquiry)\n </p>
org.kuali.rice.krad.uif.widget.Inquiry|viewName|String=When multiple target inquiry views exists for the same data object class, the view name can be set to\n determine which one to use\n\n <p>\n When creating multiple inquiry views for the same data object class, the view name can be specified for the\n different versions (for example 'simple' and 'advanced'). When multiple inquiry views exist the view name must\n be sent with the data object class for the request. Note the view id can be alternatively used to uniquely\n identify the inquiry view\n </p>
org.kuali.rice.krad.uif.widget.LightBox=Used for rendering a lightbox in the UI to display action links in dialog\n popups

org.kuali.rice.krad.uif.widget.QuickFinder|autoSearch|Boolean=Indicates whether the search should be executed when first rendering the lookup view\n\n <p>\n By default the lookup view is rendered, the user enters search values and executes the results. This flag can\n be set to true to indicate the search should be performed before showing the screen to the user. This is\n generally used when search criteria is being passed in as well\n </p>
org.kuali.rice.krad.uif.widget.QuickFinder|baseLookupUrl|String=Returns the URL for the lookup for which parameters will be added\n\n <p>\n The base URL includes the domain, context, and controller mapping for the lookup invocation. Parameters are\n then added based on configuration to complete the URL. This is generally defaulted to the application URL and\n internal KRAD servlet mapping, but can be changed to invoke another application such as the Rice standalone\n server\n </p>
org.kuali.rice.krad.uif.widget.QuickFinder|dataObjectClassName|String=Full class name the lookup should be provided for\n\n <p>\n This is passed on to the lookup request for the data object the lookup should be rendered for. This is then\n used by the lookup framework to select the lookup view (if more than one lookup view exists for the same\n data object class name, the {@link \#getViewName()} property should be specified to select the view to render).\n </p>
org.kuali.rice.krad.uif.widget.QuickFinder|disableSearchButtons|Boolean=TODO\: not implemented currently
org.kuali.rice.krad.uif.widget.QuickFinder|fieldConversions|Map=Map that determines what properties from a result lookup row (if selected) will be returned to properties on\n the calling view\n\n <p>\n The purpose of using the lookup is to search for a particular value and return that value to the form being\n completed. In order for the lookup framework to return the field back to us, we must specify the name of the\n field on the data object class whose value we need, and the name of the field on the calling view. Furthermore,\n we can choose to have the lookup return additional fields that populate other form fields or informational\n properties (see \u2018Field Queries and Informational Properties\u2019). These pairs of fields are known as\n \u2018field conversions\u2019.\n </p>\n\n <p>\n The fieldConversions property is a Map. Each entry represents a field that will be returned back from the\n lookup, with the entry key being the field name on the data object class, and the entry value being the field\n name on the calling view. It is helpful to think of this as a from-to mapping. Pulling from the data object\n field (map key) to the calling view field (map value).\n </p>
org.kuali.rice.krad.uif.widget.QuickFinder|headerBarEnabled|Boolean=TODO\: not implemented currently
org.kuali.rice.krad.uif.widget.QuickFinder|hideReturnLink|Boolean=Indicates whether the return links for lookup results should be rendered\n\n <p>\n A lookup view can be invoked to allow the user to select a value (or set of values) to return back to the\n calling view. For single value lookups this is done with a return link that is rendered for each row. This\n return link can be disabled by setting this property to true\n </p>
org.kuali.rice.krad.uif.widget.QuickFinder|lightBoxLookup|LightBox=LightBoxLookup widget for the field\n\n <p>\n The light box lookup widget will change the lookup behaviour to open the\n lookup in a light box.\n </p>
org.kuali.rice.krad.uif.widget.QuickFinder|lookupCollectionName|String=For the case of multi-value lookup, indicates the collection that should be populated with\n the return results\n\n <p>\n Note when the quickfinder is associated with a <code>CollectionGroup</code>, this property is\n set automatically from the collection name associated with the group\n </p>
org.kuali.rice.krad.uif.widget.QuickFinder|lookupCriteriaEnabled|Boolean=Indicates whether the lookup criteria (search group) should be enabled on the invoked lookup view\n\n <p>\n Setting the this to false will not display the lookup criteria but only the results. Therefore this is only\n useful when setting {@link \#getAutoSearch()} to true and passing in criteria\n </p>
org.kuali.rice.krad.uif.widget.QuickFinder|lookupParameters|Map=Map that determines what properties from a calling view will be sent to properties on that are rendered\n for the lookup view's search fields (they can be hidden)\n\n <p>\n When invoking a lookup view, we can pre-populate search fields on the lookup view with data from the view\n that called the lookup. The user can then perform the search with these values, or (if edited is allowed or\n the fields are not hidden) change the passed in values. When the lookup is invoked, the values for the\n properties configured within the lookup parameters Map will be pulled and passed along as values for the\n lookup view properties\n </p>
org.kuali.rice.krad.uif.widget.QuickFinder|multipleValuesSelect|Boolean=Indicates whether a multi-values lookup should be requested
org.kuali.rice.krad.uif.widget.QuickFinder|quickfinderAction|Action=Action component that is used to rendered for the field for invoking the quickfinder action (bringin up the\n lookup)\n\n <p>\n Through the action configuration the image (or link, button) rendered for the quickfinder can be modified. In\n addition to other action component settings\n </p>
org.kuali.rice.krad.uif.widget.QuickFinder|readOnlySearchFields|String=Comma delimited String of property names on the lookup view that should be read only\n\n <p>\n When requesting a lookup view, property names for fields that are rendered as search criteria can be marked\n as read-only. This is usually done when a lookup parameter for that property is sent in and the user should\n not be allowed to change the value\n </p>
org.kuali.rice.krad.uif.widget.QuickFinder|referencesToRefresh|String=List of property names on the model that should be refreshed when the lookup returns\n\n <p>\n Note this is only relevant when the return by script option is not enabled (meaning the server will be invoked\n on the lookup return call)\n </p>\n\n <p>\n When a lookup return call is made (to return a result value) the controller refresh method will be invoked. If\n refresh properties are configured, a call to refresh those references from the database will be made. This is\n useful if the lookup returns a foreign key field and the related record is needed.\n </p>
org.kuali.rice.krad.uif.widget.QuickFinder|showMaintenanceLinks|Boolean=Indicates whether the maintenance action links should be rendered for the invoked lookup view\n\n <p>\n If a maintenance view exists for the data object associated with the lookup view, the framework will add\n links to initiate a new maintenance document. This flag can be used to disable the rendering of these links\n </p>\n\n <p>\n Note this serves similar purpose to {@link \#getSuppressActions()} but the intent is to only remove the\n maintenance links in this situation, not the complete actions column TODO\: this is not in place\!\n </p>
org.kuali.rice.krad.uif.widget.QuickFinder|supplementalActionsEnabled|Boolean=TODO\: not implemented currently
org.kuali.rice.krad.uif.widget.QuickFinder|suppressActions|Boolean=Indicates whether the maintenance actions (or others) are rendered on the invoked lookup view\n\n <p>\n By default a lookup view will add an actions column for the result table that display maintenance links (in\n addition to a new link at the top of the page) if a maintenance action is available. Custom links can also be\n added to the action column as necessary. This flag can be set to true to suppress the rendering of the actions\n for the lookup call.\n </p>\n\n <p>\n An example of when this might be useful is when invoking a lookup to return a value to a value. Generally in\n these cases you don't want to the user going off to another view (such as the maintenance view)\n </p>
org.kuali.rice.krad.uif.widget.QuickFinder|viewName|String=When multiple target lookup views exists for the same data object class, the view name can be set to\n determine which one to use\n\n <p>\n When creating multiple lookup views for the same data object class, the view name can be specified for the\n different versions (for example 'simple' and 'advanced'). When multiple lookup views exist the view name must\n be sent with the data object class for the request. Note the view id can be alternatively used to uniquely\n identify the lookup view\n </p>

The query will be performed on the client\n to filter the provider options based on the users input instead of doing a query each time\n </p>\n\n <p>\n When a query method is configured and this option set to true the method will be invoked to set the\n options. The query method should not take any arguments and should return the suggestion options\n List or the JS String as a result. If a query method is not configured the suggest options can be\n set through configuration or a view helper method (for example a component finalize method)\n </p>
org.kuali.rice.krad.uif.widget.Suggest|valuePropertyName|String=Name of the property on the query result object that provides\n the options for the suggest, values from this field will be\n collected and sent back on the result to provide as suggest options
org.kuali.rice.krad.uif.widget.Suggest|returnFullQueryObject|boolean=When set to true the results of a query method will be used directly as the suggestions (\n it will not be assumed the method returns objects from which the source property name is then used\n to pull out the suggestions)\n\n <p>\n Note this is not supported for auto queries (only custom method queries). The query method can return\n a list of Strings which will be used for the suggestions, a list of object with 'label' and 'value' properties,\n or a custom object (if the plugin has been customized to handle the object)\n </p>
org.kuali.rice.krad.uif.widget.Suggest|suggestOptions|List=When {@link \#isRetrieveAllSuggestions()} is true, this list provides the full list of suggestions\n\n <p>\n If a query method is configured that method will be invoked to populate this list, otherwise the\n list should be populated through configuration or the view helper\n </p>\n\n <p>\n The suggest options can either be a list of Strings, in which case the strings will be the suggested\n values.
