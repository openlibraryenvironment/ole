    <title>Pessimistic Locking</title>
    <section><title>Default Pessimistic Locking</title>
        <warning><para>Only Transactional Documents may use the default Pessimistic Locking implementation.</para>
        </warning>
        <para>To lock a document via the default Pessimistic Locking mechanism means that the document 
            is locked by a user prior to any changes the user may perform. The traditional setup of documents 
            in Rice is to lock them using Optimistic Locking where two users may edit a document at the same 
            time. However, the first user to take an action that will save the document will 'win', and the 
            second user will see an error saying that the document was edited by another user. 
            For Pessimistic Locking, the first user who has edit privileges will get a lock on the document, 
            and any subsequent users who should have edit privileges on the document, who try to view the 
            document, will only get read-only access to the document, until the first user's lock is 'released'.
        </para>
        <note>
            <para>Pessimistic Locking is used in conjunction with standard Rice Optimistic Locking. 
            Currently there is no way to use Pessimistic Locking instead of the default Optimistic Locking.
        </para>
        </note>
        <para>There are  two places in Rice where Pessimistic Locks can be used:

        </para>
    </section>
    <section xml:id="locking_user_entry"><title>Locking for User Entry</title>
        <para>The default implementation for locking a document for user entry tells the system to place a lock on a 
            document if a user attempts to view it and that user has one or more 'entry' type edit modes as defined 
            by the document's Document Authorizer class. Once the lock is placed, any other user who should have 
            'entry' privileges on the document will not be allowed to do so until the lock by the first user is 
            released.
        </para>
        <note>
            <para>If the Transactional Document that will be using Pessimistic Locking has a custom Document 
                Authorizer class and uses custom edit modes returned by the getEditMode(Document, UniversalUser) 
                method, the custom authorizer class should also override the method isEntryEditMode(Map.Entry). 
                See #Defining 'Entry' Edit Modes below.

    <section><title>Customizing</title>
        <para>For extremely complex customization that goes beyond what may be described in this document a client 
            developer can look at the javadocs of the 
            <emphasis role="keyword">org.kuali.core.document.authorization.DocumentAuthorizerBase</emphasis> 
            class paying special attention to the methods below:
            <itemizedlist>
                <listitem><para>isLockRequiredByUser(Document, Map, UniversalUser)</para>
                </listitem>
                <listitem><para>isEntryEditMode(Map.Entry)</para></listitem>
                <listitem><para>getEditModeWithEditableModesRemoved(Map)</para></listitem>
                <listitem><para>getEntryEditModeReplacementMode()</para></listitem>
                <listitem><para>createNewPessimisticLock(Document, Map, UniversalUser)</para></listitem>
            </itemizedlist>
            The completely override the lock handling the Document Authorizer method 
            establishLocks(Document, Map, UniversalUser) can be overriden.
        </para>
    </section>
    <section>
        <title>Defining 'Entry' Edit Modes</title>
        <para>If the Transactional Document that will be using Pessimistic Locking has a custom Document 
            Authorizer class and uses custom edit modes returned by the 
            <emphasis role="keyword">getEditMode(Document, UniversalUser)</emphasis> method, the custom 
            authorizer class should also override the method <emphasis role="keyword">isEntryEditMode(Map.Entry)
                </emphasis>. If the entry parameter passed in is defined as a valid 'entry' mode then the method 
            should return true.</para>
    </section>
    <section>
        <title>Using custom Lock Descriptors</title>
        <para>The default Pessimistic Lock implementation does not use Lock Descriptors so only one person may 
            have a lock on a single document at any one time. If something more custom is required Lock 
            Descriptors can be used. The default implementation of a document that uses Pessimistic Locking 
            and custom Lock Descriptors is that once a single user establishes a lock on a certain document 
            with a certain lock descriptor... no other user can create a lock on that document with that descriptor. 
            If another user needs that lock created they will have read only access on the document until the other 
            user releases their lock.
        </para>
        <para><emphasis role="bold">Example</emphasis></para>
        <para>As an example, think of a document that has both an Delivery section and a Billing section. 
            Perhaps a user 'fred' has access to edit the Delivery section but not the Billing section. 
            Likewise, a user 'francine' has access to edit the Billing section but not the Delivery section. 
            In this case it would be possible for both 'francine' and 'fred' to each have a lock on a single 
            document since the data they have editable is mutually exclusive from the other. In this example 
            'fred' could have a Pessimistic Lock with a descriptor 'Delivery' while 'francine' could have a 
            Pessimistic Lock with a 'Billing' descriptor.
        </para>
        <para>
            To use lock descriptors the client application document should implement a custom Document 
            Authorizer class if not done already (see Authorizers - Client Developer Guide (0.9.3) for 
            more information). The authorizer class should override the useCustomLockDescriptors() method 
            to return true. The method getCustomLockDescriptor(Document, Map, UniversalUser) must also be 
            overriden to return the value of the desired lock descriptor. It's up to the client to determine 
            how to set these and what values to use.
        </para>
    </section>
    <section xml:id="locking_workflow_process">
        <title>Locking for Workflow Processing</title>
        <para>The default implementation for locking a document for processing by Workflow tells the 
            system to place a lock on a document once a Workflow action is taken if that Workflow action 
            is not contained in a list (see <link linkend="default_no_locks">Default Workflow Actions that 
                Don't Require Locks)</link>. The default 
            user that will 'own' the lock will be the Rice System User. Once the lock is placed, any other 
            user who should have 'entry' privileges on the document will not be allowed to do so until the 
            lock is released. Locks for Workflow processing are released once the Workflow process completes 
            successfully.
        </para>
        <note>
            <para>If a document that has a Pessimistic Lock for Workflow is not successfully processed and 
                goes into Exception Routing, the document will stay locked by the Workflow process.

        <title>Customizing</title>
        <para>The Pessimistic Locking mechanism for Workflow processes has lock creation and lock releasing 
            points that exist in a document's post processor methods. Specifically the method 
            <emphasis role="keyword">doActionTaken(ActionTakenEventVO)</emphasis> in the 
            <emphasis role="keyword">DocumentBase</emphasis> class is used to create locks while the method 
            <emphasis role="keyword">afterWorkflowEngineProcess(boolean)</emphasis> in the same class is used to 
            release locks. If a document overrides either of these methods or does not use the standard 
            KualiPostProcessor implementation, the client will need to use the DocumentBase methods code in 
            whatever method they implement if they would like Pessimistic Locking for Workflow.

        <title>Using a Custom Lock Owner</title>
        <para>
            The default owner of a Pessimistic Lock created for a Workflow process is the Rice System User. 
            To change that a client can implement a custom Document Authorizer class and override the method 
            <emphasis role="keyword">getWorkflowPessimisticLockOwnerUser()</emphasis>. This method is used to 
            get the lock owner for lock creation but also will be used to release the lock at the conclusion 
            of the Workflow process. If a non-static user will be used a client may need to override the 
            method <emphasis role="keyword">releaseWorkflowPessimisticLocking(Document)</emphasis> to 
            handle special cases.
