        <title>KSB Registry as a Service</title>
        
        <para>As of the 2.0 version of Rice, the ServiceRegistry is now itself a
            service. In order to bring the registry online for the client
            application, the application needs to configure a URL similar to the
            following:</para>
        
        <programlisting linenumbering = "numbered">&lt;param name="rice.ksb.registry.serviceUrl"&gt;http://localhost:8080/kr-dev/remoting/serviceRegistrySoap&lt;/param&gt;</programlisting>
        
        <para>Currently, this connector is only configured to understand a SOAP
            interface to the service registry which is secured by digital
            signatures. This is the only type of interface to the registry that the
            standalone server currently publishes. Additionally, only a single URL
            to the registry can be configured at the current time. If someone wants
            to do load balancing amongst potential registry endpoints, then a
            hardware or software load balancer could be configured to do
            this.</para>
