    <title>The ResourceLoader Stack</title>
    
    <section>
        <title>Overview</title>
        
        <para>Rice is composed of a set of modules that provide distinct
            functionality and expose various services. <itemizedlist>
                <listitem>
                    <para>Services in Rice are accessible by the <emphasis
                        role="bold">ResourceLoader</emphasis>, which can be thought of as
                        analogous to Spring's <emphasis
                            role="italic">BeanFactory</emphasis> interface. (In fact, Rice
                        modules themselves back ResourceLoaders with Spring bean
                        factories.)</para>
                </listitem>
                
                <listitem>
                    <para>Services can be acquired by name. (Rice adds several
                        additional concepts, including qualification of service names by
                        namespaces.)</para>
                </listitem>
                
                <listitem>
                    <para>When the <emphasis role="bold">RiceConfigurer</emphasis> is
                        instantiated, it constructs a GlobalResourceLoader that is
                        composed of an initial <emphasis
                            role="italic">RootResourceLoader</emphasis> (which may be provided
                        by the application via the RiceConfigurer), as well as resource
                        loaders supplied by each module:</para>

            </itemizedlist></para>
        
        <para>The <emphasis role="bold">GlobalResourceLoader</emphasis> is the
            top-level entry point through which all application code should go to
            obtain services. The <emphasis role="bold">getService</emphasis> call
            will iterate through each registered ResourceLoader, looking for the
            service of the specified name. If the service is found, it is returned,
            but if it is <emphasis role="italic">not</emphasis> found, ultimately
            the call will reach the <emphasis
                role="bold">RemoteResourceLoader</emphasis>. The Root ResourceLoader is
            registered by the KSB module that exposes services that have been
            registered on the bus.</para>

            <title>ResourceLoaderFactoryBean</title>
            
            <para>In addition to programmatically acquiring service references,
                you can also import Rice services into a Spring context with the help
                of the <emphasis
                    role="bold">GlobalResourceLoaderServiceFactoryBean</emphasis>:</para>
            
            <para>This bean is <emphasis role="italic">bean-name-aware</emphasis>
                and will produce a bean of the same name obtained from Rice's resource
                loader stack. The bean can then be wired in Spring like any other
                bean.</para>

            <title>Installing an application root resource loader </title>
            
            <para>Applications can install their own root ResourceLoader to
                override beans defined by Rice. To do so, inject a bean that
                implements the ResourceLoader interface into the RiceConfigurer
                rootResourceLoader property. For example:</para>
            
            <programlisting linenumbering = "numbered">&lt;!-- a Rice bean we want to override in our application --&gt;
&lt;bean id="overriddenRiceBean" class="my.app.package.MyRiceServiceImpl"/&gt;

&lt;!-- supplies services from this Spring context --&gt;
&lt;bean id="appResourceLoader" class="org.kuali.rice.core.impl.resourceloader.SpringBeanFactoryResourceLoader"/&gt;
&lt;bean id="coreConfigurer" class="org.kuali.rice.core.impl.config.module.CoreConfigurer"&gt;
    &lt;property name="dataSource" ref="standaloneDataSource" /&gt;
    &lt;property name="transactionManager" ref="atomikosTransactionManager" /&gt;
    &lt;property name="userTransaction" ref="atomikosUserTransaction" /&gt;
    &lt;property name="rootResourceLoader" ref="appResourceLoader"/&gt;
&lt;/bean&gt;</programlisting>
            
            <warning>
                <para><emphasis role="bold">Application ResourceLoader and Circular
                    Dependencies</emphasis></para>
                
                <para>Be careful when mixing registration of an application root
                    resourceloader and lookup of Rice services through the
                    GlobalResourceLoader. If you are using an application resourceloader
                    to override a Rice bean, but one of your application beans requires
                    that bean to be injected during startup, you may create a circular
                    dependency. In this case, you will either have to make sure you are
                    not unintentionally exposing application beans (which may not yet
                    have been fully initialized by Spring) in the application
                    resourceloader, or you will have to arrange for the GRL lookup to
                    occur lazily, after Spring initialization has completed (either
                    programmatically or through a proxy).</para>

            <title>Overriding Rice services: Alternate method</title>
            
            <para>A Rice-enabled webapp (including the Rice Standalone
                distribution) contains a multiple module configurers, typically
                defined in an xml Spring context file. These load the Rice modules.
                Each module has its own ResourceLoader, which is typically backed by
                an XML Spring context file. Overriding and/or setting global beans
                and/or services (such as data sources and transaction managers) is
                done as described above. However, because in each module services can
                be injected into each other, overriding module services involves
                overriding the respective module's Spring context file.</para>
            
            <para>The cleanest way to do this is to set the
                rice.*.addtionalSpringFiles to an accessible spring beans file that
                overrides one or more spring beans in the existing module's context.
                Each rice module has a corresponding configuration parameter that can
                be pointed to a file that will override any existing services.</para>
            
            <programlisting linenumbering = "numbered">&lt;param name="rice.kew.additionalSpringFiles"&gt;classpath:myapp/config/MyAppKewOverrideSpringBeans.xml&lt;/param&gt;

&lt;param name="rice.ksb.additionalSpringFiles"&gt;classpath:myapp/config/MyAppKsbOverrideSpringBeans.xml&lt;/param&gt;

&lt;param name="rice.krms.additionalSpringFiles"&gt;classpath:myapp/config/MyAppKrmsOverrideSpringBeans.xml&lt;/param&gt;

&lt;param name="rice.kim.additionalSpringFiles"&gt;classpath:myapp/config/MyAppKimOverrideSpringBeans.xml&lt;/param&gt;</programlisting>
