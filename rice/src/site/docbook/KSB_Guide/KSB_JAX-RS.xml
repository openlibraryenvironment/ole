                <para>The KSB does <emphasis role="bold">not</emphasis> currently
                    support "busSecure" (digital signing of requests &amp; responses)
                    REST services. Attempting to set a REST service's "busSecure"
                    property to "true" will result in a RiceRuntimeException being
                    thrown. Rice can be customized to expose REST services in a secure
                    way, e.g. using SSL and an authentication mechanism such as client
                    certificates, but that is beyond the scope of this
                    documentation.</para>

        <title>A Simple Example</title>
        
        <para>To expose a simple JAX-RS annotated service on the bus, you can
            follow this recipe for your spring configuration (which comes from the
            Rice unit tests):</para>
        
        <programlisting linenumbering = "numbered">&lt;!-- The service implementation you want to expose --&gt;

&lt;bean id="baseballCardCollectionService" class="org.kuali.rice.ksb.testclient1.BaseballCardCollectionServiceImpl"/&gt;


&lt;!-- The service definition which tells the KSB to expose our RESTful service --&gt;
&lt;bean class="org.kuali.rice.ksb.messaging.RESTServiceDefinition"&gt;
    &lt;property name="serviceNameSpaceURI" value="test" /&gt;


    &lt;!-- as noted earlier, the servicePath property of RESTServiceDefinition can't be set here  --&gt;


    &lt;!-- The service to expose.  Refers to the bean above --&gt;
    &lt;property name="service" ref="baseballCardCollectionService" /&gt;


    &lt;!-- The "Resource class", the class with the JAX-RS annotations on it.  Could be the same as the  --&gt;
    &lt;!-- service implementation, or could be different, e.g. an interface or superclass    --&gt;
  
    &lt;property name="resourceClass" 
value="org.kuali.rice.ksb.messaging.remotedservices.BaseballCardCollectionService" /&gt;


    &lt;!-- the name of the service, which will be part of the RESTful URLs used to access it --&gt;
    &lt;property name="localServiceName" value="baseballCardCollectionService" /&gt;
&lt;/bean&gt;
</programlisting>
        
        <para>The following java interface uses JAX-RS annotations to specify
            its RESTful interface:</para>
        
        <programlisting linenumbering = "numbered">// … eliding package and imports

@Path("/")
public interface BaseballCardCollectionService {
    @GET
    public List&lt;BaseballCard&gt; getAll();


    /**
      * gets a card by it's (arbitrary) identifier
      */
    @GET
    @Path("/BaseballCard/id/{id}")
    public BaseballCard get(@PathParam("id") Integer id);
    /**
      * gets all the cards in the collection with the given player name
      */
    @GET
    @Path("/BaseballCard/playerName/{playerName}")
    public List&lt;BaseballCard&gt; get(@PathParam("playerName") String playerName);


    /**
      * Add a card to the collection.  This is a non-idempotent method
      * (because you can add more than one of the same card), so we'll use @POST
      * @return the (arbitrary) numerical identifier assigned to this card by the service
      */
    @POST
    @Path("/BaseballCard")
    public Integer add(BaseballCard card);


    /**
      * update the card for the given identifier.  This will replace the card that was previously
      * associated with that identifier.
      */
    @PUT
    @Path("/BaseballCard/id/{id}")
    @Consumes("application/xml")
    public void update(@PathParam("id") Integer id, BaseballCard card);


    /**
      * delete the card with the given identifier.
      */
    @DELETE
    @Path("/BaseballCard/id/{id}")
    public void delete(@PathParam("id") Integer id);

    /**
      * This method lacks JAX-RS annotations
      */
    public void unannotatedMethod();
}</programlisting>
        
        <para>Acquisition and use of this service over the KSB looks just like
            that of any other KSB service. In the synchronous case:</para>
        
        <programlisting>BaseballCardCollectionService baseballCardCollection = (BaseballCardCollectionService) GlobalResourceLoader.getService(new QName("test", "baseballCardCollectionService");
);


List&lt;BaseballCard&gt; allMyMickeyMantles = baseballCardCollection.get("Mickey Mantle");
// baseballCardCollection.&lt;other service method&gt;(...)
// etc</programlisting>

    <section>
        <title>Composite Services</title>
        
        <para>It is also possible to aggregate multiple Rice service
            implementations into a single RESTful service where requests to
            different sub-paths off of the base service URL can be handled by
            different underlying services. This may be desirable to expose a RESTful
            service that is more complex than could be cleanly factored into a
            single java service interface.</para>
        
        <para>The configuration for a composite RESTfull service looks a little
            bit different, and as might be expected given the one-to-many mapping
            from RESTful service to java services, there are some caveats to using
            that service over the KSB. Here is a simple example of a composite
            service definition (which also comes from the Rice unit tests):</para>
        
        <programlisting linenumbering = "numbered">&lt;bean class="org.kuali.rice.ksb.messaging.RESTServiceDefinition"&gt;
    &lt;property name="serviceNameSpaceURI" value="test" /&gt;
    &lt;property name="localServiceName" value="kms" /&gt;
    &lt;property name="resources"&gt;
        &lt;list&gt;
            &lt;ref bean="inboxResource"/&gt;
            &lt;ref bean="messageResource"/&gt;
        &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;/property&gt;
    &lt;property name="servicePath" value="/" /&gt;
&lt;/bean&gt;


&lt;!-- the beans referenced above are just JAX-RS annotated Java services --&gt;
&lt;bean id="inboxResource" class="org.kuali.rice.ksb.testclient1.InboxResourceImpl"&gt;
    &lt;!-- ... eliding bean properties ... --&gt;
&lt;/bean&gt;
&lt;bean id="messageResource" class="org.kuali.rice.ksb.testclient1.MessageResourceImpl"&gt;
    &lt;!-- ... eliding bean properties ... --&gt;

&lt;/bean&gt;</programlisting>
        
        <para>As you can see in the bean definition above, the service name is
            kms, so the base service url would by default (in a dev environment) be
            <emphasis
                role="bold">http://localhost:8080/kr-dev/remoting/kms/</emphasis>.
            Acquiring a composite service such as this one on the KSB will actually
            return you a <emphasis
                role="bold">org.kuali.rice.ksb.messaging.serviceconnectors.ResourceFacade</emphasis>,
            which allows you to get the individual java services in a couple of
            ways, as shown in the following simple example:</para>
        
        <programlisting>ResourceFacade kmsService =
 (ResourceFacade) GlobalResourceLoader.getService(
new QName(NAMESPACE, KMS_SERVICE));


// Get service by resource name (url path)
InboxResource inboxResource = kmsService.getResource("inbox");
// Get service by resource class
MessageResource messageResource = kmsService.getResource(MessageResource.class);</programlisting>
    </section>
    
    <section>
        <title>Additional Service Definition Properties</title>
        
        <para>There are some properties on the RESTServiceDefinition object that
            let you do more advanced configuration:</para>
        
        <section>
            <title>Providers</title>
            
            <para>JAX-RS Providers allow you to define:<itemizedlist>
                <listitem>
                    <para>ExceptionMappers which will handle specific Exception
                        types with specific Responses.</para>
                </listitem>
                
                <listitem>
                    <para>MessageBodyReaders and MessageBodyWriters that will
                        convert custom Java types to and from streams.</para>
                </listitem>
                
                <listitem>
                    <para>ContextResolver providers allow you to create special
                        JAXBContexts for specific types, which will gives you fine
                        control over marshalling, unmarshalling, and validation.</para>
                </listitem>
            </itemizedlist></para>
            
            <para>The JAX-RS specification calls for classes annotated with
                @Provider to be automatically used in the underlying implementation,
                but the CXF project which Rice uses under the hood does not (at the
                time of this writing) support this configuration mechanism, so this
                configuration property is currently necessary.</para>
        </section>
        
        <section>
            <title>Extension Mappings</title>
            
            <para>Ordinarily you need to set your ACCEPT header to ask for a
                specific representation of a resource. ExtensionMappings let you map
                certain file extensions to specific media types for your RESTful
                service, so your URLs can then optionally specify a media type
                directly. For example you could map the <emphasis
                    role="bold">.xml</emphasis> extension to the media type <emphasis
                        role="bold">text/xml</emphasis>, and then tag .xml on to the end of
                your resource URL to specify that representation.</para>
        </section>
        
        <section>
            <title>Language Mappings</title>
            
            <para>language mappings allow you a way to control the the
                Content-Language header, which lets you specify which languages your
                service can accept and provide.</para>
        </section>
        
        <section>
            <title>Additional Information</title>
            
            <para>For more information on what these properties provide, it may be
                helpful to consult the JAX-RS specification, or the CXF
                documentation.</para>
