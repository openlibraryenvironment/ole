        <title>Kuali Rice Implementations</title>
        <para>Kuali Rice is available for two types of implementations, Standalone Server and
            Bundled (packaged with Kuali applications).</para>
        <section>
            <title>Standalone Server </title>
            <para>The Standalone Server is the most versatile implementation of Rice. It is a web
                application that can provide services to multiple applications that integrate with
                Kuali Rice at your institution. The server distribution contains a web archive or
                WAR file for the Kuali Rice standalone server. The Standalone Server distribution is
                the one you should use when your enterprise wants to run multiple Kuali applications
                or when you want to integrate other applications with Rice. </para>
        </section>
        <section>
            <title>Bundled</title>
            <para>When an application bundles all of the Rice functionality (including what is
                usually handled by the standalone server) into the client application, it's called a
                Bundled Distribution. Kuali Financial Systems (KFS), Kuali Coeus (KC), and Kuali
                Student (KS) all offer bundled distributionswhere you do not need to set up and
                install a Rice standalone server; the necessary Rice functionality is bundled with
                the application. Bundled Distributions are not recommended for enterprise
                implementations, but are good for quick start, testing, and demonstrations.</para>

        <section>
            <title>Source Code Distribution</title>
            <para>The Source Code Distribution is available if you want to build Rice from scratch
                and create the standalone or binary libraries yourself.</para>
        </section>
        <section>
            <title>Binary Distribution</title>
            <para>The Binary Distribution (also known as the client distribution) is a collection of
                JAR files. It is used when other applications need to use your Rice implementation
                and you won't be using the Rice web application. It is designed for embedding Rice
                and can be used as a set of libraries for client applications.</para>
            <para>The Binary Distribution of Kuali Rice is implemented as an application framework
                consisting of application programming interfaces (APIs), libraries, and the web
                framework. This allows you to construct a Kuali Rice application. All JARs and web
                content are included in this version.</para>
        </section>
        <section>
            <title>Server Distribution</title>
            <para>This is the distribution that contains the standalone server WAR.</para>
        </section>
        <section>
            <title>Which Distribution to Use</title>
            <para>In a typical enterprise deployment of Kuali Rice, a Standalone Rice server hosts
                numerous shared services and provides the most versatility. The composition of Rice
                contains an application framework — the APIs, Libraries, and web framework that are
                used to construct a Rice application. You can configure subsequent Rice client
                applications to interact with these services as needed. </para>
