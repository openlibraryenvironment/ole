    <para>Kuali Rice has six core modules, linked together by the Kuali
    Service Bus (KSB):<orderedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>KSB (Kuali Service Bus )</para>

          <para>Kuali Service Bus is a simple service bus geared toward easy
          service integration in an SOA.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>KEW (Kuali Enterprise Workflow)</para>

          <para>Kuali Enterprise Workflow provides a common routing and
          approval engine that facilitates the automation of business
          processes across the enterprise. KEW was specifically designed to
          address the requirements of higher education, so it is particularly
          well suited for routing mediated transactions across departmental
          boundaries.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>KEN (Kuali Enterprise Notification)</para>

          <para>Kuali Enterprise Notification acts as a enabler for all
          university business-related communications by allowing end-users and
          other systems to push informative messages to the campus community
          in a secure and consistent manner.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>KIM (Kuali Identity Management)</para>

          <para>Kuali Identity Management provides central management features
          for person identity characteristics, groups, roles, permissions, and
          their relationships to each other. All integration with KIM is
          accomplished using simple and consistent service APIs (Java or Web
          Service). KIM is built like all of the Kuali applications with
          Spring at its core, so that you can implement your own Identity
          Management (IdM) solutions behind the Service APIs. This provides
          you with the option to override the reference service
          implementations with your own to integrate with other Identity and
          Access Management systems at your enterprise.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>KNS (Kuali Nervous System)/KRAD</para>

          <para>Kuali Nervous System/KRAD is a software development framework
          that enables developers to quickly build business applications in an
          efficient and agile fashion. KNS is an abstracted layer of "glue"
          code that provides developers easy integration with the other Rice
          components.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>KRMS (Kuali Rules Management System)</para>

          <para>Kuali Rules Management System is a new module of Kuali Rice
          that allows business rules that were previously coded within
          electronic documents or applications to be externalized into a rules
          repository with its own set of user interfaces. Removing this
          critical logic from being coded into the document allows for the
          maintenance of rules in a fashion that does not require application
          deployment or development for updates. In addition to the rules, a
          new routing option called PeopleFlow has been introduced to provide
          a streamlined way to view and update routing actions without having
          to have a deep understanding the KEW and its user interfaces or the
          impact changes may incur.</para>

    <para>Kuali Rice is designed to run in a clustered environment and can be
    run on virtual machines.</para>

    <section>
      <title>KSB (Kuali Service Bus)</title>

      <para>The Kuali Service Bus (KSB) is a lightweight service bus designed
      so developers can quickly develop and deploy services for remote and
      local consumption. You deploy services to the bus either using the
      Spring tool or programmatically. Services must be named when they are
      deployed to the bus. Services are acquired from the bus using their
      name.</para>

      <para>At the heart of the KSB is a service registry. This registry is a
      listing of all services available for consumption on the bus. The
      registry provides the bus with the information necessary to achieve load
      balancing, failover, and more.</para>

        <title>KSB Features</title>

        <itemizedlist>
          <listitem>
            <para><emphasis role="bold">Transactional Asynchronous
            Messaging</emphasis> – Call services asynchronously to support a
            'fire and forget' model of calling services. Messaging
            participates in any existing JTA transactions (messages are not
            sent until the current running transaction is committed and are
            not sent if the transaction is rolled back). This increases the
            performance of service-calling code because it does not wait for a
            response.</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para><emphasis role="bold">Synchronous Messaging</emphasis> -
            Call any service on the bus using a request-response
            paradigm.</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para><emphasis role="bold">Queue Style Messaging</emphasis> -
            Execute Java services using message queues. When a message is sent
            to a queue, only one of the services listening for messages on the
            queue is given the message.</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para><emphasis role="bold">Topic Style Messaging</emphasis> -
            Execute Java services using messaging topics. When a message is
            sent to a topic, all services listening for messages on the topic
            receive the message.</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para><emphasis role="bold">Quality of Service</emphasis> - This
            KSB feature determines how queues and topics handle messages with
            problems. Time-to-live is supported, giving the message a
            configured amount of time to be handled successfully before
            exception handling is invoked for that message type. Messages can
            be given a specified number of retry attempts before exception
            handling is invoked. An increasing delay separates each calling.
            Exception handlers can be registered with each queue and topic for
            custom behavior when messages fail and Quality of Service limits
            have been reached.</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para><emphasis role="bold">Discovery</emphasis> - Automatically
            discover services along the bus by service name. You do not need
            end-point URLs to connect to services.</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para><emphasis role="bold">Reliability</emphasis> - Should
            problems arise, messages sent to services via queues or
            synchronous calls automatically fail-over to any other services
            bound to the same name on the bus. Services that are not available
            are removed from the bus until they come back online, at which
            time they will be rediscovered for messaging.</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para><emphasis role="bold">Persisted Callback</emphasis> - Send
            callback objects with any message. These objects will be called
            each time a service is "requested." This provides a mechanism to
            pass along a message. In this way, deployed services can
            communicate back to a "callback registrant," such as an
            application registering a callback, with application data even as
            that data is moving through the system.</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para><emphasis role="bold">Primitive Business Activity
            Monitoring</emphasis> - If turned on, each call to every service,
            including the parameters passed into that service, is
            recorded.</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para><emphasis role="bold">Spring-Based Integration</emphasis> -
            KSB is designed with Spring-based integration in mind. For
            example, you might make an existing Spring-based POJO available
            for remote asynchronous calls.</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para><emphasis role="bold">Programmatic Integration</emphasis> -
            If you do not use Spring configuration, you can configure KSB
            programmatically. Services can also be added and removed from the
            bus programmatically at runtime.</para>

      </section>

      <section>
        <title>Bean Based Services</title>

        <para>Typically, KSB programming is centered on exposing
        Spring-configured beans to other calling code using a number of
        different protocols. Using this paradigm, the client developer and the
        organization can rapidly build and consume services.</para>
      </section>

        <title>Overview of Supported Service Protocols</title>

            <para>This drawing is conceptual and not representative of true
            deployment architecture.</para>
          </note></para>

        <para>Essentially, the KSB is a registry with service-calling behavior
        on the client end (for Java clients). All policies and behaviors
        (aysnc vs. sync) are coordinated on the client.</para>

        <para>KSB offers clients some very attractive messaging features:
        <itemizedlist>
            <listitem>
              <para>Synchronization of message sending with currently running
              transaction (In other words, all messages sent during a
              transaction are ONLY sent if the transaction is successfully
              committed.)</para>
            </listitem>

            <listitem>
              <para>Failover: If a call to a service comes back with a 404 (or
              various other network-related errors), the client will try to
              call other services of the same name on the bus. This is for
              both sync and async calls.</para>
            </listitem>

            <listitem>
              <para>Load balancing: Clients will round-robin call services of
              the same name on the bus. Proxy instances are, however, bound to
              single machines. This is useful if you want to keep a line of
              communication open to a single machine for long periods of
              time</para>
            </listitem>

            <listitem>
              <para>Topics and Queues: Used for controlling the execution of
              services</para>
            </listitem>

            <listitem>
              <para>Persistent messages: When using message persistence, a
              message cannot be lost. It will be persisted until it is
              sent.</para>
            </listitem>

            <listitem>
              <para>Message Driven Service Execution: Bind standard JavaBean
              services to messaging queues for message-driven beans</para>

      <title>KEW (Kuali Enterprise Workflow)</title>

      <para>The Kuali Enterprise Workflow (KEW) is a content-based routing
      engine. To enter the routing process, a user creates a document from a
      process definition and submits it to the workflow engine for routing.
      The engine then makes routing decisions based on the XML content of the
      document.</para>

      <para>KEW is built for educational institutions to use for business
      transactions in the form of electronic documents that require approval
      from multiple parties. For example, these types of transactions are
      capably handled with KEW:<itemizedlist>

      and are delivered to a single list where other messages such as
      workflow-related items (KEW action items) also reside. In addition,

        <title>KIM Features</title>

        <para>KIM provides a reference implementation of services. It also
        allows customization and/or replacement to facilitate integration with
        institutional services or other third-party identity management
        solutions. This allows the core KIM services to be overridden
        piecemeal. For example, you can override the Identity Service, but
        keep the Role Service.</para>

        <para>KIM consists of these services, which encompass its API:

      <title>KNS (Kuali Nervous System)</title>

      <para>The Kuali Nervous System (KNS) is the core of the Kuali Rice
      system. It embraces a document- centric (business process) model that
      uses workflow as a central concept. It is also the web application
      development framework for Rice and is the core technical module in Rice,
      leveraging reusable code components to provide functionality.</para>

    <title>Physical Architecture Overview</title>

    <section>
      <title>Production Platform</title>

      <para>Since the builders of the Rice platform constructed it on open
      source technologies, your scale and use of Rice software determine the
      layout of the logical and physical hardware you need to support your
      implementation. Below are several conceptual models for implementation
      of Rice that are certainly not end solutions. Your solution depends on
      your implementation scale and budget.</para>

      <section>
        <title>Production Platform</title>

        <para>The production platform that you deploy for your implementation
        can vary quite widely. The first example, the most basic platform
        structure, would be the most economical solution in terms of hardware.
        The Tomcat server can serve up all web service and HTTP requests and
        store all content. (Of course, you could load-balance multiple Tomcat
        servers across machines.) A picture of the logical structure:</para>

        <figure>
          <title>Conceptual Production Architecture, example 1</title>

            </imageobject>
          </mediaobject>
        </figure>

        <para>For this architecture, we recommend this minimum:<itemizedlist>
            <listitem>
              <para>Server running Tomcat container: Minimum 2 GB main
              memory</para>
            </listitem>
          </itemizedlist></para>

        <para>The next example has you offload the web requests and content to
        an Apache HTTP server in front of the Tomcat server:</para>

        <figure>
          <title>Conceptual Production Architecture, example 1</title>

            </imageobject>
          </mediaobject>
        </figure>

        <para>For this architecture, we recommend this minimum:<itemizedlist>
            <listitem>
              <para>Server running Apache: Minimum 1 GB main memory</para>
            </listitem>

            <listitem>
              <para>Server running Tomcat container: Minimum 2 GB main
              memory</para>
            </listitem>
          </itemizedlist></para>

        <para>And finally, the recommended solution, where the focus of the
        environment structure is based upon maximal scaling for the Rice
        application:</para>

            </imageobject>
          </mediaobject>
        </figure>

        <para>For this architecture, we recommend this minimum:<itemizedlist>
            <listitem>
              <para>Load Balancer</para>
            </listitem>

            <listitem>
              <para>Each server running Apache: Minimum 1 GB main
              memory</para>
            </listitem>

            <listitem>
              <para>Each server running Tomcat container: Minimum 2 GB main
              memory</para>
            </listitem>
          </itemizedlist></para>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Development Platform</title>

      <para>The most basic platform for development has the Tomcat container
      and a MySQL server running on the same machine as your development
      tools:</para>

      <figure>
        <title>Recommended Conceptual Production Architecture</title>

          </imageobject>
        </mediaobject>
      </figure>

      <para>The best option is to use the Tomcat container to serve up web
      service and HTTP requests. This has the least number of software layers
      between your development/debugging/IDE environment and the Tomcat
      container.</para>
