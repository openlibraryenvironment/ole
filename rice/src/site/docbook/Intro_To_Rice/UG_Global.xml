        <para>It is important that you have a general understanding of how Rice is a part of a
            larger Kuali community before you begin to use this as a reference.</para>

            <para>The Kuali Foundation employs staff to coordinate partner efforts and to manage and
                protect the Foundation's intellectual property. The Kuali Foundation manages a
                growing portfolio of enterprise software applications for colleges and universities.
                A lightweight Foundation staff coordinates the activities of Foundation members for
                critical software development and coordination activities such as source code
                control, release engineering, packaging, documentation, project management, software
                testing and quality assurance, conference planning, and educating and assisting
                members of the Kuali Partners program.</para>

            <title>Kuali Rice</title>
            <para>Kuali Rice is a higher-education, community-source software project that is merely
                a spoke in the wheel of the larger Kuali Community. The Kuali Community is the hub
                of a wheel of a growing number of communities, each of which are made up of people
                and functions. Together they form a comprehensive suite of open, modular and
                distributed administrative software systems that bring the proven functionality of
                legacy applications to the ease and universality of online services. The Kuali
                Foundation serves them all, with specific responsibilities related to keeping the
                wheel in motion. Each individual community shares a similar organizational structure
                and some modular functionality while its components are able to stand alone to
                perform unique functions. While all are designed for seamless integration with each
                other, each project is made up of modules that offer a variety of implementation
                combinations to suit any Carnegie-class institution's unique business needs.</para>
            <para>Should you want to learn more detail about how the Rice community is organized,
                structured and operates you should reference the Rice Charter which is available for
                review in the Foundation archives.</para>

        <title>How to Use This Guide</title>
        <para>The table of contents leads you to headings and subtopic headings that provide
            information ranging from simple notes to a thorough review of what to do and why, with
            frequent examples. Sequential tasks are numbered, notes and action results are indented,
            and user interface element references are formatted to enhance readability. Mouse
            pointer icons and callouts are used frequently to show you what to click on at each
            process step.</para>
        <section>
            <title>User Guide Structure</title>
            <para>Each chapter is comprised of sections or subsections that correspond to modules within Rice. In
                order to reduce the required effort for documentation maintenance, the documentation
                is structured so as to not repeat the same material across various chapters/sections/subsections. </para>
            <para>Likewise, the chapters are designed to cross-reference appendices such as the Data
                Element Dictionary, Glossary of Terms, Report Catalog and Index, to reduce redundant
                information within the chapter bodies and give you one common location for
                information lookup.</para>
        </section>
        <section>
            <title>Typographic Conventions</title>
            <para>This document adheres to specific documentation standards and style conventions to
                optimize readability. The formatting of text used to name user interface elements is
                typically bold to enhance visual comprehension and improve usability.</para>

        <section>
            <title>Versioning</title>
            <para>If you have received a printed copy of this user guide, please note that as Rice
                is improved and enhanced, corresponding updated releases of the documentation are
                available online. To ensure you have the latest and most current user guide at any

                wherever possible to allow for efficient navigation to sections and subsections of

            <title>Useful Screens Are Where You Need Them</title>
            <para>One of the beauties of Rice is that it shows you just the screens and fields that
                are useful for your Rice Role and the function you need. For example, if your Role
                in Rice lets you create new Rice documents, then you can see a create new button on
                appropriate screens. If you click this button, you go directly to the screen for
                creating new documents. People whose Role doesn't create new documents aren't
                bothered with this button on their screens.</para>
            <para>Screens with information or functions that can be used in many places in Rice are
                very conveniently linked to those places, so useful screens are always at your
                fingertips. For example, screens that use Person information display a link to the
                Person Lookup screen. This lets you search for the exact Person you need and enter
                that Person's information automatically on those screens. (In Rice, a Person is a
                set of information about a real person or something that stands for real people,
                like a job title.)</para>
            <para>Not only will you find links to a useful screen like Person Lookup on many other
                screens, but what you see on that useful screen may depend on how you get to it. For
                example, if you go to the Person Lookup screen from an Administration menu and
                search for a Person, the search results list has Actions in the left column, and the
                link for each Person in the Actions column takes you to the edit screen for that
                Person.</para>
            <para>On the other hand, if you go to a Person Lookup screen from other locations, the
                left column of your search results list has a return value link. You can click this
                link on the row for the Person you need to close the Person Lookup screen and
                automatically enter the information for that Person on the original screen (the
                screen where you clicked the magnifying glass icon).</para>

            <para>To make it easier to do your work, Rice often provides access to the same
                information from several screens. Some of the most frequently used are described

                <title>Ad Hoc Recipients Tab</title>
                <para>The Ad Hoc Recipients tab allows you to interrupt the normal workflow routing
                    of a document and include other individuals or groups in its routing path. Ad
                    Hoc Routing does not replace the normal workflow routing of the document; it
                    adds people or groups to the normal routing. </para>
                <para>The Ad Hoc Recipients tab has two sections: Person Requests and Ad Hoc Group
                    Requests. Use one or both of the sections to route the document to an additional
                    person, group, or both.</para>
