        <section>
            <title>Data Objects</title>
            <para>We begin our training for the Kuali Rapid Application Development framework with the
                data access layer. Enterprise applications generally have a large number of CRUD (Create
                Read Update Delete) operations; therefore, the access of data is a very important
                concern of development. KRAD builds on top of other tools to provide general facilities
                that greatly reduce the development time. These facilities are known as the KRAD
                Persistence Framework. </para>
            <para>The foundation of the KRAD Persistence Framework is the third party ORM (Object
                Relational Mapping) tool. ORM tools target the persistence of data with a relational
                database. This is achieved by mapping a Java object that contains the data to one or
                more database tables. When a persistence operation is requested, the ORM tool performs
                the work of translating the request along with the corresponding object(s) to the
                necessary DML statement. This provides a great advantage to the application as it
                generally requires no database dependent code (database specific code might be required
                in certain cases). More information on particular ORM tooling will be provided in the
                sections 'OJB Primer' and 'Using JPA'. </para>
            <para>In order to prepare our application for persisting data using an ORM tool, we must
                build the objects that will hold the application data. From the established data model,
                we can determine the objects needed using a mapping strategy. Although the strategies
                and options available depend on the ORM solution we are using, generally we have the
                following mapping options: <orderedlist>
                    <listitem>
                        <para> One table to one object </para>
                    </listitem>
                    <listitem>
                        <para> One table to multiple objects (polymorphism) </para>
                    </listitem>
                    <listitem>
                        <para> Multiple tables to one object </para>
                    </listitem>
                </orderedlist></para>
            <para>Once we have determined how an object will relate with its database table(s), each
                object property is associated with a table column through configuration. This
                configuration will also give the ORM tool information on data type conversion and
                constraints. The final piece to our object mapping is specifying any relationships.
                This includes one-to-one, one-to-many, and many-to-many relationships. </para>
            <tip><para>Referential Integrity: It is not required to have referential integrity set up in the database
                    for relationships declared for the persistent metadata. However, it is generally
                    good practice to do so.</para></tip>
            <para>Now let's set aside the mapping concerns and have a closer look at our 'data' objects.
                Technically, these objects are not complex at all. First, they must adhere to the POJO
                (Plain Old Java Object) and JavaBean guidelines. These guidelines are as follows: <orderedlist>
                    <listitem>
                        <para>Is Serializable (implements the java.io. Serializable interface) </para>
                    </listitem>
                    <listitem>
                        <para>Has a no-arg constructor </para>
                    </listitem>
                    <listitem>
                        <para>Provides property getter and setter methods using the conventional
                            (get{PropertyName} for getter, set{PropertyName} for setter, and
                            is{PropertyName} for Booleans) </para>
                    </listitem>
                </orderedlist></para>
            <para>In addition to the 'primitive' property types a data object may contain, a data
                object may also be composed of nested data objects (representing a one-to-one
                relationship), or a collection of data objects (representing a one-to-many
                relationship). </para>
            <tip><para><emphasis role="keyword">Related Data Objects</emphasis>: It is important to setup the related
                    data object properties. As we will see later on, the framework can take care of
                    many things for us automatically based on the metadata derived from these
                    relationships. </para></tip>
            <para>Next, well that's it! However, as we will see in just a bit, in order to take
                advantage of the additional persistence features KRAD provides, there is one
                additional thing we need to add. </para>
            <para>KRAD refers to any object that provides data as a 'Data Object'. Data objects provide
                a very central role in an enterprise application. Within the suggested KRAD
                architecture, they are not bound to just the data access layer, but can freely move
                between the other application layers as well. This means we can use data objects in our
                services, and we can use them to build our user interfaces. </para>
            <tip><para><emphasis role="keyword">'Data Object'</emphasis>: The 'Data Object' term can refer to objects
                    that are mapped to a persistence mechanism, but also might not be. For example,
                    it might be an object whose data is assembled by a service call, which in turn
                    interacts with other persisted objects or other services. This flexibility is
                    important for allowing other KRAD modules to be used with a variety of data
                    sources and strategies.</para></tip>
            <para><emphasis role="bold">Best Practice</emphasis>: Keep data objects simple! Try to avoid
                introducing any business logic or presentation logic into the objects. </para>
        </section>
        <section>
            <title>Business Objects </title>
            <para>A special type of data object in KRAD is known as a Business Object. These are
                data objects that implement the interface org.kuali.rice.krad.bo.BusinessObject.
                There are two primary types of business object: those that persist to the database
                and those that do not. Those business objects that do persist to the database should
                implement the org.kuali.rice.krad.bo.PersistableBusinessObject interface. This
                interface adds persistence related methods that are invoked throughout the
                framework. </para>
            <para>Generally, when creating a new data object, it is more convenient to extend one of
                the provided base classes that implement the necessary interfaces. For persistable
                objects, this base class is org.kuali.rice.krad.bo. PersistableBusinessObjectBase.
                Within this base class, default implementations for the persistable methods exist
                along with properties for the common fields required for all persisted objects.
                These are described in more detail later on in this section. Business objects that
                do not persist to the database can extend
                org.kuali.rice.krad.bo.TransientBusinessObjectBase. </para>
            <tip><para><emphasis role="keyword">Transient Business Objects</emphasis>: Transient business objects were
                    necessary in earlier versions of Rice, due to the framework requiring all
                    objects to be business objects (including the UI generation). With version 2.0
                    of Rice and KRAD, this restriction no longer exists; therefore there is really
                    no need for the transient business object concept. </para></tip>
            <para>In order to take advantage of all the features KRAD provides, it is recommended
                that all persistable objects (and therefore tables) contain two properties: <orderedlist>
                    <listitem>
                        <para>Version Number – This property holds a version for the record that is
                            maintained by the ORM tool to perform optimistic locking. The number is
                            initially set to 0. Each time the record is updated, the version number
                            is incremented. Before updating the record, the ORM tool performs a
                            comparison between the version number on the data object, and the
                            version number of the record in the database. If they are different, the
                            tool knows the record has been updated since the record was pulled and
                            throws an optimistic lock exception. </para>
                    </listitem>
                    <listitem>
                        <para>Object Id – This property holds a GUID value for each record in the
                            database. This is used in the framework as an alternate key for the
                            record. Example usages of the object id include the notes and
                            attachments framework. Notes are associated with a record by its object
                            id. Another example is its use within the multi-value lookup framework.
                            Selected records are identified and retrieved based on their unique
                            object ids. </para>
                    </listitem>
                </orderedlist></para>
        </section>
        <section>
            <title>Special Business Objects </title>
            <para>Additional functionality exists for a few special types of business objects. One
                of these special types is business objects that have an active status. That is, each
                record has a state of active (which generally means the record is valid for using)
                or inactive (meaning the record should not be used due to being old or not currently
                valid). Objects of this type should implement the Inactivatable interface. This
                interface requires the methods isActive() and setActive(Boolean active) to be
                implemented. </para>
            <para>The simplest form of inactivatable business objects are those that maintain a
                single field that indicates the active status as a Boolean field. Another common
                case is that of an active date range (also known as effective dating). These objects
                maintain two fields that work together for determining the active status. This first
                of these fields is the active begin date which indicates the date on which the
                record becomes active. This field can have a null value indicating the record is
                active for all dates before the end date. The second field is the active end date
                which indicates the date on which the record becomes inactive. This field can have a
                null value indicating the record has no inactive date set. </para>
            <para> Record is active if:
                <programlisting linenumbering = "numbered">(activeFromDate == null ||
    asOfDate >= activeFromDate.getMillis()) &amp;&amp;  (activeToDate == null ||
    asOfDate &lt; activeToDate.getMillis());   </programlisting>
                where the asOfDate is the current date or a date we wish to simulate the active
                check for. </para>
            <para>For inactivatable business objects that use effective dating, the
                org.kuali.rice.krad.bo.InactivatableFromToImpl class can be extended which holds the
                necessary properties and implements the logic necessary to determine the active
                status (note that this class implements the Inactivatable and InactivatableFromTo
                interfaces). </para>
            <para>When an object is marked as inactivatable, KRAD will give us some nice features
                for handling the active status: <itemizedlist>
                    <listitem>
                        <para><emphasis role="bold">Validation of active status for foreign key
                                fields </emphasis></para>
                        <para>As we will see later on in the section 'Automatic Validation', KRAD
                            can perform a lot of the common validation tasks for us. One of these is
                            known as default existence checks. This is validation that is performed
                            on one or more user inputted fields to verify the value given exists in
                            the related database table. To perform this validation, the framework
                            uses the configured relationship for the inputted fields (inputted
                            fields are the foreign keys). In addition to performing the existence
                            checks, we can ask for the active status to be verified as well. If the
                            record exists but the active flag is false, an error message will be
                            displayed to the user. </para>
                    </listitem>
                    <listitem>
                        <para><emphasis role="bold">Inactivation Blocking </emphasis></para>
                        <para>Changing the active status for a record to false (or inactive) is
                            known as inactivation. Problems with data integrity can occur if we
                            inactivate a record that is referenced (by a foreign key relationship)
                            by another active record. For these cases we want to ensure the record
                            with the relationship is inactivated before the related record. Using a
                            feature known as Inactivation Blocking we can disallow the user from
                            inactivating a record when this condition exists. </para>

                        <para>UI controls like the select and radio group can get their option
                            values from a class known as KeyValueFinder (more on this in 'Types of
                            Controls'). For easy building of these option classes, the UIF provides
                            a generic configurable KeyValueFinder that will exclude inactive records
                            from the options list if the option providing class implements

            <para>Another special type of business objects are code/name objects. These objects all
                contain a field that represents a code, and a field that gives the name for that
                code (or description). In many cases these are the only two fields present. Business
                objects of this type should implement the org.kuali.rice.krad.bo.KualiCode interface
                (or extend org.kuali.rice.krad.bo.KualiCodeBase). When presenting code values that
                have a related object of type KualiCode, the framework will do translation to
                display the name or the code and name. </para>

        <title>OJB Primer </title>
        <para><link xlink:href="http://db.apache.org/ojb/">Apache ObJectRelationalBridge</link>
            (OJB) is an Object/Relational mapping tool that allows transparent persistence for Java
            Objects against relational databases. OJB takes care of building and executing all the
            necessary database statements (SQL) for managing the persistence of an application's
            data. This not only saves a lot of development time, but also allows for easier support
            of multiple database vendors. This section will cover the basics of OJB necessary for
            KRAD development. </para>
        <tip><para>The OJB Project: OJB is a 'dead' project, meaning no active work is being done to enhance the
                codebase. Rice is in the process of migrating from OJB to <link
                    xlink:href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/articles/javaee/jpa-137156.html"
                    >JPA</link> (Java Persistence Architecture) with a Hibernate backend. The
                timeline for completion of that work is in 2013 with the release of Rice 2.3. It is
                possible currently to use JPA in a Rice application, however some of the persistence
                features provided need to be implemented by the application.</para></tip>
        <para>We make use of OJB with XML that provides the mapping metadata. Generally each
            application module has one or more files that contain this XML. These files are picked
            up through the module configuration (see New Project Setup):
            <programlisting linenumbering = "numbered">&lt;bean id="sampleAppModuleConfiguration" class="org.kuali.rice.krad.bo.ModuleConfiguration">
    ... 
    &lt;property name="databaseRepositoryFilePaths">
        &lt;list>
            &lt;value>OJB-repository-sampleapp.xml&lt;/value>
        &lt;/list>
    &lt;/property>
&lt;/bean>    </programlisting></para>
        <section>
            <title> OJB XML METADATA </title>
            <para>All OJB files must begin with the standard XML declaration, and then the OJB
                doctype tag (root element):
                <programlisting linenumbering = "numbered">&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
&lt;descriptor-repository version="1.0">
...
&lt;/descriptor-repository>  </programlisting></para>
            <para>Next, our OJB file must contain a jdbc-connection-descriptor which configures the
                database connection OJB will use for the contained mappings:
                <programlisting linenumbering = "numbered">&lt;jdbc-connection-descriptor
    jcd-alias="dataSource"  default-connection="false"
    jdbc-level="3.0" eager-release="false" batch-mode="false" useAutoCommit="0"
    ignoreAutoCommitExceptions="false">  &lt;object-cache
    class="org.apache.ojb.broker.cache.ObjectCachePerBrokerImpl" />  
    &lt;sequence-manager className="org.kuali.rice.core.framework.persistence.ojb.ConfigurableSequenceManager">
        &lt;attribute attribute-name="property.prefix" attribute- value="datasource.ojb.sequenceManager" />
    &lt;/sequence-manager>
&lt;/jdbc-connection-descriptor>   </programlisting></para>
            <para>Note that jcd-alias="dataSource" refers to the name of the data source configured
                in spring bean XML. Also note the use of the Rice ConfigurableSequenceManager. This
                allows configuration through the Rice configuration API of the sequence for a
                property (such as starting sequence value). </para>
        </section>
        <section>
            <title>CLASS DESCRIPTORS </title>
            <para>New data object mappings are added to OJB by adding a class-descriptor tag. One or
                more class descriptors can be added to an OJB file after the
                jdbc-connection-descriptor. With the class descriptor, we must specify the fully
                qualified java class for mapping with the class attribute and the database table
                name with the table attribute:
                <programlisting linenumbering = "numbered">&lt;class-descriptor class="org.kuali.rice.krad.demo.travel.account.TravelAccount" table="TRV_ACCT">
    ... 
&lt;/class-descriptor>      </programlisting></para>
        </section>
        <section>
            <title>FIELD DESCRIPTORS </title>
            <para>Now that we have our object-table mapping with the class descriptor, we can start
                mapping the primitive fields of our object using a field-descriptor tag. We place
                the field descriptors inside our class descriptor, indicating they all belong to
                that class. With the field descriptor we must specify the property name using the
                name attribute, and the table column name using the column attribute. In addition,
                we need to specify the JDBC type for the table column using the jdbc-type attribute.
                This indicates to OJB how it should convert the value between the database and
                object layers. </para>
            <programlisting linenumbering = "numbered">&lt;field-descriptor name="name" column="acct_name" jdbc-type="VARCHAR" /&gt;     </programlisting>

            <title> DATATYPE CONVERSION </title>
            <para>Based on the given jdbc type, OJB can then convert the database value to the
                appropriate type for the base Java types. However, KRAD provides some additional
                data types, and applications may develop their own as well. In these cases, OJB will
                not be able to convert the value itself. However, OJB does provide a conversion
                facility that we can hook into and perform the necessary conversion. </para>
            <para>We must create a class that implements the OJB interface
                org.apache.ojb.broker.accesslayer.conversions.FieldConversion. This requires us to
                then implement two methods. The first is named javaToSql and is invoked to convert
                the custom Java type to one of the Java types supported by OJB. The second method is
                named sqlToJava and is invoked to convert the value coming from the database to our
                custom type. In short, OJB will perform the standard conversion based on the table
                above, then invoke our converter class to convert from the base Java type to the
                custom type. </para>

            <para>Once we have a converter class (or one is provided), we need to tell OJB to use it

            <para>These three data types provide a standard way of handling scale and rounding. In
                the case of KualiDecimal, the scale is set to 2, and the rounding behavior is 'Round
                Half Up'. KualiInteger has a scale of 0, and uses 'Round Half Up' rounding as well

                    exceed value). For example, 23.5 rounds to 24, 23.4 round to 23, -23.5 rounds to

            <para>In addition to the convertors provided by Rice for the custom data types, a few

            <para>The first of these is OjbCharBooleanConversion. A typical practice in legacy
                systems (before the introduction of database Boolean types) is to represent a
                Boolean by a single character string. Some common mappings are 'T' for true : 'F'
                for false, or 'Y' for true : 'N' for false. The Rice Boolean converter can be
                specified for a field to convert these string values to the correct Boolean property
                type. Other variations of the Boolean converter exist for other mapping strategies
                such as '1' : '0', 'A' : 'I', 'true' : 'false', and 'yes' : 'no'. </para>
            <para>Finally, Rice provides a converter for encrypting secure database contents. The
                name of this converter is OjbKualiEncryptDecryptFieldConversion. This converter
                relies on the EncryptionService implementation to perform the encryption. Values are
                encrypted for storing in the database and then decrypted for object population. </para>

        <section>
            <title> OTHER FIELD DESCRIPTOR ATTRIBUTES </title>
            <para>All field descriptors must have the name, column, and jdbc-type attributes. In
                addition to these we can make use of other OJB attributes to provide further column
                information. </para>
            <para>Foremost among these is the primarykey attribute. This attribute simply takes a
                Boolean value of true (by default false for all columns) to indicate the column for
                the field descriptor is a primary key. All class descriptors must have at least one
                field descriptor with the primarykey="true" attribute. OJB uses the primary key
                information in many places, including determining whether to do an insert or update
                statement (see 'The BusinessObjectService' for more information). In addition,
                primary keys are used for linking relationships. </para>
            <para>Compound keys are configured by adding the primarykey="true" attribute to more
                than one field:

            <para>A single primary key field can also be a surrogate key for which a sequence is
                used to generate the key values. We can indicate to OJB that the primary key is a
                sequence using the autoincrement and sequence-name attributes:
                <programlisting linenumbering = "numbered">&lt;class-descriptor class="edu.sampleu.bookstore.bo.Book" table="BK_BOOK_T">
    &lt;field-descriptor name="id" column="BOOK_ID" jdbc-type="BIGINT" primarykey="true" autoincrement="true" 
     sequence-name="BK_BOOK_ID_S" /> 
...  </programlisting></para>
            <para>In this class descriptor for Book, we have a primary key field named 'id'.
                Furthermore, the values for the book id field are generated by a sequence named
                'BK_BOOK_ID_S'. When OJB performs an insert on the BK_BOOK_T table, it will retrieve
                the next value from the book id sequence and use it as the id for the new record. </para>
            <tip><para><emphasis role="keyword">Sequence Name</emphasis>: Requiredness of the sequence-name attribute
                    depends on the sequence manager being used (configured through the
                    jdbc-connection-descriptor). OJB supports several sequence managers that have
                    different strategies for generating the ID (some not requiring an actual
                    database sequence). However, the recommendation is to use the provided Rice
                    sequence manager which does rely on a database sequence. </para></tip>
            <para>Now that we have our primary key fields set, recall the recommendation that all
                persisted objects carry the version number and object id properties. We can map
                these properties with the follow field descriptors:
                <programlisting linenumbering = "numbered">&lt;field-descriptor name="versionNumber" column="VER_NBR" jdbc-type="BIGINT" locking="true" />
&lt;field-descriptor name="objectId" column="OBJ_ID" jdbc-type="VARCHAR" indexed="true" />   </programlisting></para>
            <para>Note the locking and indexed attributes. The locking attribute tells OJB to use
                this column to perform optimistic locking and only one field descriptor may have
                this attribute set to true. The indexed attribute indicates to OJB that we have a
                database index on this field. OJB can then use that information for optimizing
                queries. </para>
        </section>
        <section>
            <title> REFERENCE DESCRIPTORS </title>
            <para>After mapping all of the class primitive fields using field descriptors, we must
                then map our relationships to other data objects. In code, these relationships are
                properties just like the primitive fields that persist to table columns. However,
                the difference with these properties is their type is another data object (in the
                case of 1-1) or a collection of other data objects (in the case of 1-many). </para>
            <para>First, let's take the case of 1-1 relationships. To map these we use the
                reference-descriptor tag. A class descriptor can contain one or more
                reference-descriptor tags. When using a reference descriptor tag we must specify the
                name attribute which holds the name of the property we are describing (similar to
                the name attribute in a field descriptor). Then we must specify the class of the
                related object using the class-ref attribute. </para>
            <para>For example, suppose we had the following property in our Book data object that
                references a BookType:
                <programlisting>public class Book extends PersistableBusinessObjectBase {   
...
    private BookType bookType;       </programlisting></para>
            <para> Our corresponding reference descriptor will then be:
                <programlisting linenumbering = "numbered">&lt;reference-descriptor name="bookType" class-ref="edu.sampleu.bookstore.bo.BookType"/&gt;     </programlisting></para>
            <para>We are not quite finished though with our reference descriptor. OJB can now
                determine we have a foreign key relationship from Book to BookType, and it knows the
                primary key fields for BookType, but which fields of Book are the actual foreign
                keys? To fill in this information, within our reference descriptor we must add a
                foreign key field for each primary key field of BookType. </para>
            <programlisting linenumbering = "numbered">&lt;reference-descriptor name="bookType" class-ref="edu.sampleu.bookstore.bo.BookType">
    &lt;foreignkey field-ref="typeCode" />
&lt;/reference-descriptor></programlisting>
            <para>When using the foreignkey tag, we must specify the field-ref attribute whose value
                is the name of the field in the class holding the relationship (in this case Book)
                that is the foreign key. The number of foreignkey tags must match the number of
                primary key fields in our class descriptor. Note also the order the foreign keys are
                declared must match the order in which they join to the primary keys. For example,
                if our reference target class has primary key fields code and subCode, and we have
                foreign keys fkCode and fkSubCode, the following configuration would be incorrect:
                <programlisting linenumbering = "numbered">&lt;reference-descriptor name="subCode" class-ref="edu.sampleu.SubCode">
    &lt;foreignkey field-ref="fkSubCode"/>
    &lt;foreignkey field-ref="fkCode" />
&lt;/reference-descriptor></programlisting></para>
            <para>Here the order of foreign keys is reversed which will cause OJB to join the
                fkSubCode with code, and fkCode with subCode. </para>
            <para>Similar to the field descriptor, OJB provides additional attributes we can specify
                for a reference descriptor. Three of these attributes are prefixed with 'auto-' and
                designate how OJB should handle the reference during retrieve, update (or insert),
                and delete operations. The first of these is the auto-retrieve attribute, and
                indicates whether the reference should be retrieved when the main (or parent) object
                is retrieved. The attribute can be specified as 'false' (reference should not be
                retrieved) or 'true' (reference will be retrieved). When auto-retrieve=false is
                specified, the reference object will be null on the main object after retrieval. OJB
                provides mechanisms for retrieving the reference through code, which will be
                discussed in the upcoming section 'Reference Refreshing'. </para>
            <para>The auto-update attribute specifies whether the reference object should be updated
                when an update is done on the main object. This attribute can have a value of 'none'
                – meaning no update should happen for the reference – and 'object' – meaning the
                reference record should be updated with the main object. In addition, an option of
                'link' can be specified, which is just relevant for one-to-many relationships. This
                performs an update on the indirection table, but not the actual reference table. </para>
            <para>The final auto attribute is auto-delete, which indicates whether the reference
                object should be deleted when the main object is deleted. Similar to auto-update,
                'none', 'link', or 'object' can be given for the value. </para>
            <para>Care must be taken when setting the auto-retrieve attribute. Having the reference
                ready without having to make an extra call is a great programming convenience.
                However, performance can suffer due to the time required to initially load the
                reference objects with the main object, in particular for objects with several
                relationships. Furthermore, optimizing the auto-retrieve setting can be difficult,
                due to it being a global setting, and the developer often not knowing when the
                reference data will be needed. Don't worry though; OJB has another attribute we can
                use! This attribute is named proxy and can have a value of 'true' or 'false' (the
                default). Adding proxy=true to our reference descriptor allows OJB to use lazy
                loading for our reference. Essentially, this allows us to use the reference when
                needed without making an additional call, but the full record is not loaded
                initially with the main object which will help performance. To make this work, OJB
                will initially create a proxy object for the property value. When a method is
                invoked on the proxy object (such as a getter or setter), OJB will fetch the record
                and populate the reference object. </para>
            <tip>    
                <para><emphasis role="bold">Using Proxies</emphasis>: Note that using proxy=true
                    changes when the reference object is loaded, and works best for cases where the
                    reference record is often not needed. For cases where the reference record is
                    usually needed, loading up front with the main object is a better choice. In
                    particular, proxies can lead to issues with a large number of SQL calls being
                    made when generating the UI. </para>
                <para>Using the proxy attribute on a reference can also cause issues with code
                    logic. Recall that OJB will not attempt to retrieve the reference upfront when
                    proxy=true is given, and sets the value for our reference property to the proxy.
                    One side effect of this is that doing a standard null check on a reference
                    object can give us false information. </para>
                <para>For example, suppose we do a null check on our bookType reference and if not
                    null return the name of the book type:
                    <programlisting>if ((book != null) &amp;&amp; (book.getBookType() != null)) { 
    return book.getBookType().getName();  
}   </programlisting></para>
                <para>In this example, it is possible to get a NullPointerException on our return
                    statement! This is because initially OJB has set the bookType property to the
                    Proxy object, which is not null. When we invoke the getName() property, OJB will
                    then attempt to execute the retrieval of the book type. Now it is possible that
                    book type does not exist, which will cause the bookType object to be null. Then
                    invoking getName() on a null will cause the NullPointerException.</para>

        <section>
            <title>Collection Descriptors</title>
            <para>Similar to the reference descriptor, the collection descriptor maps a reference
                (nested) data object in the database. However, collection descriptors are used for
                one-to-many relationships where the property is a List type. </para>
            <para>To map these we use the collection-descriptor tag. A class descriptor can contain
                one or more collection-descriptor tags. When using a collection descriptor tag, we
                must specify the name attribute which holds the name of the property we are
                describing (similar to the name attribute n reference descriptor). Then we must
                specify the class of the related object using the class-ref attribute (again similar
                to reference descriptor). </para>
            <para>For example, suppose we had the following property in our Book data object that
                references a List of Authors:
                <programlisting>public class Book extends PersistableBusinessObjectBase {  
    ... 
    private List&lt;Author> authors;   </programlisting></para>
            <para> Our corresponding collection descriptor will then be:
                <programlisting linenumbering = "numbered">&lt;collection-descriptor name="authors" class-ref="edu.sampleu.bookstore.bo.Author"/&gt;     </programlisting></para>
            <para>When configuring a collection descriptor, the foreign key direction goes from the
                target class to the source. That is, we need to specify the field in the target
                class (in this case Author) that maps to the primary key of the source class (Book).
                This is done using the inverse-foreignkey tag:
                <programlisting linenumbering = "numbered">&lt;collection-descriptor name="bookType" class-ref="edu.sampleu.bookstore.bo.Author">
    &lt;inverse-foreignkey field-ref="bookId" />  
&lt;/collection-descriptor>        </programlisting></para>
            <para>The collection descriptor supports the same auto-x attributes we saw in reference
                descriptor. <xref linkend="fig5"/> gives a picture of the reference and collection descriptors </para>
