                <para>A list of the user's notification and workflow items. Also called the user's
                    Notification List. Clicking an item in the Action List displays details about

                    it is a workflow item. The user will usually load the document from their Action
                    List in order to take the requested action against it, such as approving or
                    acknowledging the document.</para>
