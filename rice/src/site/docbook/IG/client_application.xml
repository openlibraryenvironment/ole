    <title>Creating a Client Application</title>
    <para>Developing a Rice application is essentially no different than other J2EE applications.
        Any tool that can be used for creating J2EE apps can be used for a Rice app. Essentially
        Rice is a set of libraries that are used with your project (like many other libraries a J2EE
        app includes) and configured for your needs.</para>

    <para>The essential tools for developing a project are documented in the next section.</para>

            <title>IDE (Integrated Development Environment)</title>
            <para>This is the tool you will use to developer the source code and resources for your
                project. It can be a simple text editor if you want, however it is recommended to
                use one of the Java IDE tools available. Of these Eclipse, Intellij, and NetBeans
                are the most popular in today's market. Any of these will be fine for developing a
                Rice project. However, as we will learn about next, Rice provides its own tooling to
                help getting started with Eclipse. Eclipse is chosen due to its high use and that it
                is a free open source tool. The latest release is 'Indigo' and can be downloaded
                here: </para>

            <title>Database</title>
            <para>Rice applications can use a MySql or Oracle database for persisting
                application data. Rice itself will use the database for supporting the various Rice modules
                (workflow, identity management, and so on). With each Rice distribution datasets are
                provided that can be used to create the initial database schema. You can choose to load the
                'bootstrap' dataset, which provides the baseline data needed to run Rice, or the 'demo'
                dataset which adds additional demo data (such as example KIM data and workflow doc types). 
                Although it is possible to provide a shared database for development, it is recommended for
                productivity reasons for each developer to have a local database installed. Both MySql and
                Oracle provide freely available databases for development. Currently Rice has been tested
                with the following versions:</para>

            <para>Note for working with a MySql database the MySql Workbench (available for free
                download) is very useful and can save time for those new to MySql.
            </para>

            <para>Once the database provider is installed, we can then load one of the provided datasets using the
                Kuali ImpEx tool. The ImpEx tool is a Kuali-developed application which is based on Apache
                Torque. It reads in database structure and data from XML files in a platform independent way
                and then creates the resulting database in either Oracle or MySQL. To use this tool we
                simply provide configuration about the location of the source dataset, along with
                connectivity information for our target database. This is done by creating a properties file
                named 'impex-build.properties' in the user home directory. Once the configuration is
                complete, we can invoke the tool using ant or maven and our database will be
                created.</para>

        <section>
            <title>JDK</title>
            <para>In order to support compilation of the application source code a JDK must be
        installed (Note this must be the JDK and not a Java Runtime Environment – JRE). Rice
        requires a JDK version of 1.6.x or 1.7.x. Additionally, Rice has only been tested with the
        Sun JDK implementation. Therefore use of other implementations such as OpenJDK may have
        problems.</para>

            <para>For machines running Windows, JDK 6 can be downloaded at the
                following URL:</para>

            <para>
                <link
                    xlink:href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html"
                    >http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html</link>
            </para>

            <para>If you are on a Mac, then Java 6 should already be installed if you are up to date with
            the latest updates from Apple.</para>

            <para>You will also want to set up your JAVA_HOME environment variable to point to the
                installation directory of your JDK. In both Windows and Mac environments, the java
                executable program should already be on your path. But if it is not, you will want to
                include JAVA_HOME/bin in your PATH environment variable.</para>

            <para>In order to verify that your JDK has been installed successfully, open a command prompt
            and type the following: </para>

            <programlisting>java -version</programlisting>
            <para>You should see output similar to the following:</para>
            <programlisting>java version "1.7.0_10"
Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.7.0_10-b18)
Java HotSpot(TM) Client VM (build 23.6-b04, mixed mode)</programlisting>
            <para>If you receive an error indicating that the "java" command could not be found,
                please ensure that the java command is on your machine's <emphasis role="bold"
                    >PATH</emphasis> environment variable.</para>
        </section>

        <section>
            <title>Maven</title>
            <para>Maven is the primary build tool used by the Kuali Rice project. Maven is
                based on a project object model (POM) that defines various standards and conventions
                surrounding the organization of a project. This facilitates a set of standard build
                goals and lifecycle phases (such as compile, test, package, etc.). Maven is
                particularly helpful in terms of dependency management. When building a Rice
                application using Maven, all of the dependent libraries will be pulled in
                automatically.</para>

            <para>It is not a required for Rice enabled applications to be Maven projects. Again, Rice
                is essentially a set of jars that can be used with an application. However using Maven
                simplifies the setup process greatly. For example applications not using Rice must pull
                in and manage all of the third party libraries that are needed by Rice. That has an impact
                not only on initial project setup, but also each time that application is upgraded to
                a new Rice version.</para>

            <para>To download version 3 of Maven, use the following link:</para>

            <para><link xlink:href="http://maven.apache.org/download.html"
                >http://maven.apache.org/download.html</link></para>

            <para>You will want to set your M2_HOME environment variable to point to the location
                where you unzipped Maven. You will additionally want to include M2_HOME/bin in your
                PATH environment variable so that maven can be executed from the command line without having
                to specify the full path.</para>

            <para>In order to verify that Maven has been installed successfully and is available on
                the path, open a command prompt and type the following:</para>
            <programlisting>mvn -version</programlisting>
            <para>You should see output like the following:</para>
            <programlisting>Apache Maven 3.0.3 (r1075438; 2011-02-28 10:31:09-0700)

                please ensure that the directory that includes the mvn executable (<emphasis
                    role="bold">M2_HOME/bin</emphasis>) is on your machine's <emphasis role="bold"

        <section>
            <title>Servlet Container</title>

            <para>In order to run our Rice application we need have a servlet
                container. The servlet container serves the web requests for a J2EE application. There
                are many containers available for use, but Tomcat is most commonly used. Kuali Rice
                2.0 supports the following Tomcat version:</para>

                container such as Jetty. The Rice project provides a sample Jetty Server that can be used
                for your project. The next section will cover this in more detail.</para>

        <title>Importing into Eclipse</title>

        <para>Now we have our project setup and are ready to begin development. Note at this point
            the application is completely runnable. We could do a maven deploy, copy the generated
            war to our tomcat server, and start up the application. However we are going to first
            import our project to Eclipse so that we will be ready to develop further application
            code.</para>

        <para>Navigate to the Eclipse installation directory. There you should find an executable
            named 'eclipse.exe'. Once this file is found double click to start the IDE. When Eclipse
            starts up for the first time it will ask you to choose a workspace. This is a directory
            that Eclipse place newly created projects and will also read current projects from. A
            standard within the community is to use '/java/projects' for your working space. Note
            you can select the checkbox to use the directory as your default and Eclipse will not
            prompt on the next startup.</para>

        <para><emphasis role="bold">Eclipse Memory:</emphasis> It is generally needed and
            recommended to allocate additional JVM memory for the Eclipse runtime. This can be done
            by opening up the file named 'eclipse.ini' that exists in the root installation
            directory. At the end of the file you specify VM arguments as follows:</para>
        <programlisting linenumbering = "numbered">-vmargs
-Xms128m
-Xmx1024m
-XX:MaxPermSize=512m</programlisting>

        <para>The amount of memory allocated depends on the host machine. The above settings are for
            a machine with 4g of memory.</para>


        <para>When working with Eclipse for the first time, there are additional plugins you
                will likely want to get. None of these are required by Rice and depend on your
                institutional development environment and how you plan to create your project.
                However, most projects today use SVN or GIT for source code control. Therefore an
                additional Eclipse plugin is needed for communicating with the repository. Also if
                you have chosen to use Maven (or used the create project script) the Eclipse Maven
                plugin will be very useful as well.</para>

         <para>To bring a new project into eclipse, select the File-Import menu
         option. This should bring up a dialog as show in next figure.</para>

        <figure>
            <title>Eclipse Import</title>
            <mediaobject>

                </imageobject>
            </mediaobject>
        </figure>

         <para>For the import source select 'Existing Projects info Workspace'. This should
         bring up a dialog that looks like the following figure. </para>

        <figure>
            <title>Eclipse Import Project Directory</title>
            <mediaobject>
                <imageobject>

                </imageobject>
            </mediaobject>
        </figure>

        <para>Here click the 'Browse' button to locate the directory for the project. After
            selecting the project location click the 'Finish' button. Eclipse will then import the
            project contents and you are ready to begin coding!</para>
