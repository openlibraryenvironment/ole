To upgrade a Rice 2.1.6 database to Rice 2.2.4,

1. run the appropriate scripts in the "scripts/upgrades/2.1.3 to 2.2.1/final"
   folder.

2. run the appropriate scripts in the "scripts/upgrades/2.2.1 to 2.2.2/final"
   folder.

3. run the appropriate scripts in the "scripts/upgrades/2.2.3 to 2.2.4/final"
   folder.

Note that there were no database upgrade scripts for the 2.2.3 version, hence
the apparent gap in the sequence above.
